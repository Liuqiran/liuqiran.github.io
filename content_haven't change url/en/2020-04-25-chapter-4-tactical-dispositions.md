_見勝不過思人之所知, 非善之善者也。_  
Know the ken of the common herd is not enough.

_故善戰者, 立於不敗之地, 而不失敵之敗也。_  
不失敵之敗 equals does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.

_是故勝兵先勝而後求戰_  
We need to lay plans before the battle.

_勝者之戰民也, 若決積水於千例之豁者, 形也。_  
This kind of conquering force, it&#8217;s like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm.
