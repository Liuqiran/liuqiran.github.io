All warfare is based on deception, so we should deceive both of our friends and enemies.

If your opponent is bad temper, irritate him. Observe your enemy, if they are in ease, make him not rest, if they are united, separate him.

The goal is, use their weaknesses and disrupt their disadvantages.

Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

These strategies should be calculated before the war, more calculated, more possibilities for the win.
