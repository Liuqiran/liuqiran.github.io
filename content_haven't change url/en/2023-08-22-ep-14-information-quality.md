In my own opinion, there are three kinds of information in our life.  
The first one is text, the second is audio, the last one is video.  
Let&#8217;s talk about the first one. The content of texts is based on words. It&#8217;s the most abstract form of information. If we are literate, we can understand words, then we can understand road signs, posters, magazines, and books. It&#8217;s simplest to save texts for us. It&#8217;s also a form that can save the best information quality. But it&#8217;s maybe the hardest information to understand. Books contain the deepest information quality.  
Audio is another kind of information, it&#8217;s based on sounds. It&#8217;s more natural to us because we can use our ear to understand. But we can&#8217;t control the speed of understanding. We probably also receive some useless information.  
The third one is video. It combines sound and image. We can understand it very well, but it&#8217;s more shallow. Normally, information quality of video is not that good.
