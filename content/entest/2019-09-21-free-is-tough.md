Today I browsed many articles about free software, especially [this article][1], Stallman is sort of extreme, why I always care about extremely security and privacy too?

I&#8217;m not an extreme person in any topic, I need to have my life and my own goal, but because of my personality, I stick to some thinking that makes me different from others, in the end, it doesn&#8217;t make me very happy.

My dreams(like become a native speaker or improve my skill and knowledge reserve very fast) are building in the air, not in the reality, why I cannot enjoy the road?

Today when I was coping my words three years ago, I found I wrote some [emotional words][2], it shows me that I&#8217;m already in loneliness three years ago, so where is the long light? I need to find in my heart and outside in the same time, I think if I found, I will find my quietness and tranquility in my heart.
