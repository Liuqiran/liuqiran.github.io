Bilbo met a Gollum. Gollum lived on a slimy island in the dark lake. Gollum can eat goblins, but he also likes riddle.  
<q>What have I got in my pocket?</q> This riddle is not fair for Gollum.  
Bilbo got a ring! It&#8217;s Gollum&#8217;s birthday present! Bilbo Baggins, he is a thief!  
Now the ring made Bilbo invisible. He escaped the cave from goblins!
