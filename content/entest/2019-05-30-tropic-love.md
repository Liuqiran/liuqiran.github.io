不知道为什么，听到这个背景音乐会感觉到有点伤心？是宝座被夺去的那一刻吗？

I remember the ocean, Memories die out so hard. We were traveling the mountains, just to find the loudest seas. We settled down by the fire, knowing we could aim higher, but we didn&#8217;t know that yet. So if you want something to hold on to, gotta find it first. But here I am.

&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve been laying under palm trees, waiting for the summer, knowing there&#8217;s nowhere to do. &#8216;Cause I am happy on this island, Wanna be my funland? I don&#8217;t ever want to leave, I&#8217;m in a tropic love.
