I may have a porn addiction recently. Watching pornography made me immersed in fantasies, not realities. Maybe I should control my desires.

There are a lot of noises make us surrender, TV dramas, and social media make us passive. The meaning of life should be like this, it should be like that. They just mention soft moralities (compassion, kindness) rather than hard moralities ( Powerful, justice). it makes us easy to control, let us succumb to desires.

Propaganda makes us easy to control: just fxxking, just have fun! sex, drugs, rock, and roll.

Life does not only have pleasures.

Just like I wrote in [decentralization.][1]

Life is my own.
