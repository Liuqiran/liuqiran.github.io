When we were kids, elders always tell us not to lie. But most of us lie because we are afraid of the consequences after telling the truths. As a child, lying is a good protection.&nbsp;

It&#8217;s always a bad habit to lie to yourself or to other people.

Lying can distort our understanding of reality. When we lie to ourselves, at first we think we can avoid the difficulties or solve some problems. But we will gradually lose the ability to face the real world.

The truth is cruel, but the truth also reflects our own weaknesses. We will grow if we face the truth, instead of letting our shell made of lies become so thick that we cannot break out of it.
