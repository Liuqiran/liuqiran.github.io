_All external vision and sound are suspended,_&nbsp;_Perpetual thought itself gropes in time and space;_&nbsp;_Then, the spirit at full gallop reaches the eight limits of the cosmos,_&nbsp;_And the mind, self-buoyant, will ever soar to new unsurmountable heights._&nbsp;Through arduous work, we can reach the artistic impulse.

### II. Liu Hsieh and His Literary Theories {#ii-liu-hsieh-and-his-literary-theories.wp-block-heading}

**1. Liu Hsieh the Man**  
He is commissioned by Emperor Wu, and became a monk.  
His Buddhist name is Hui-ti.  
In the world with transitory nature, writing is a worthy way to reach immortality.

**2. Liu Hsieh’s Classicism**  
&#8220;On Tao, the Source,&#8221; followed by &#8220;Evidence from the Sage.&#8221;  
He considerd that sages established the mindof the literature universe.  
The Li-sao contains a style of tien and kao.  
_He believes that Yue-fu rose after the decline of the ya and odes._&nbsp;literary history, literary theory and literary appreciation and evaluation formed the literary criticism.  
He gave Lu Zhi a verdict, said that its superficial attention to details which causing Wen Fu cannot dealt with the substance.  
_Literature is both sweet and useful._  
He had a broad view of the literature scope.  
Liu also emphasize the influence from moral and political.

Literary forms are not fallacious in themselves. It&#8217;s the reason that later poets fabricated emotions to fit literary forms.

Liu conceives of eight different sytles which vary with individuals.

Genius have the ability to forge metaphors.

We cannot work against our nature. If we don&#8217;t work with, we would be exhausted and withered up.  
The chapter &#8220;The Nourishing of Vitality&#8221; is a lession in spontaneity, he is effect by Chuangtzu.

_He condemns the popular view of depreciating the contemporaries and worshipping the Ancients._  
Maybe it&#8217;s his habit that he reiterated the traditional theory of poetic function and development. But, on the other hand, he still emphasized Poetry must change according to the needs of new ages.  
_He pays lip service to the Classics._  
Literary value can not be formed when writers always conform to the Classics.

He didn&#8217;t talked about Classics when he was dealing with something which is purely literary, the only reference to the Classiscs is in the part &#8220;elegance and grace.&#8221;
