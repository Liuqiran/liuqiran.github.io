Being into the state of flow is beneficial to your mental and physical health.

**USING MORE OF YOUR BRAIN**  
Using your left side of your brain is important, you need to shift into a state of flow. You need to stop your linear thought.

**IT’S ONLY YOUR FIRST DRAFT**  
Creativity is important, how to get into it? You need to suspend criticism and linear thought and get into the state of flow.

**LEARNING TO FOCUS**  
Here is an exercise of focus just needs two minutes, it is intentionally created in two minutes then you can exercise at any time anywhere.

**FOCUSING EXERCISE**  
Sitting upright in your chair and practice it. Close your eyes, be relaxed, focus on your breath.&nbsp;**Letting go of the past. Letting go of the future. Centering in the present.**&nbsp;Counting up 1 to three. 1: from not knowing to know how to start. 2: more relaxed alert, use the superior wisdom of the subconscious mind. 3: my eyes open, eager to work. If you are fear of outside dangers, you can use it as a tool to protect your self, you surely can form a safe and supportive atmosphere.

**RELAXATION EXERCISE**  
It’s your relax, just take two minutes.

**INCORPORATING FLOW STATES INTO YOUR PROGRAM**  
You just need to think about, when, where and what, when you start, where you start and what you will do. Once you&#8217;ve done this process, tap into the flow state.
