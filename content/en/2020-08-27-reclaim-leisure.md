﻿**Leisure and the good life**  
As Aristotle&#8217;s lead, joyful activities is a &#8220;source of inward joy&#8221;. We can call them high-quality leisure.

**The Bennett principle**  
(FI 2.0 movement is that if you can radically reduce your living expenses, you gain two advantages&#8211; you save money at a much faster pace and you don&#8217;t have to save as much to become independent.)  
When you gain FI at a young age, you gain much leisure hours.

_when individuals in the FI community are provided large amounts of leisure time, they often voluntarily fill these hours with strenuous activity._  
Leisure time is very important for us. We need to clear our mind and keep from junk.

Leisure Lesson #1: **Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption.**  
When you use your brain and be strained, you will get a high-quality leisure time rather than scrolling your phone like zombie. In my opinion, some stuffs such as videos full of useless information.

**ON CRAFT AND SATISFACTION**  
Cultivating a high-quality leisure life needs effort.  
physical world is better than digital world. _Similarly, composing a song in a digital sequencer misses the pleasures that come from the nuanced struggle between fingers and steel strings that defines playing a guitar well…_  
Leisure Lesson #2: **Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world.**

**Supercharged sociality**  
Leisure Lession #3: **Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions.**

Rich social interactions is very important. Board game is a good choice.

### The Leisure Renaissance {.wp-block-heading}

some high-quality pursuits depends on the strategic use of new technologies.

**Practice: Fix or build something every week**  
You can be handy in the physical world.  
Learning a new skill is a very good way.

**Practice: Schedule your low-quality leisure**  
How much time?

**Join things**  
_Reaping these benefits in your own community._  
Join some things new, don&#8217;t be afraid. Like Franklin, become a member first.

**Practice: Follow leisure plan**  
Don&#8217;t get whole blocks of time with no schedule, no expectations, and no activity. These decompression sessions have their place, but thier rewards are muted.
