  Goal: supportive of yourself
</p>

The questions about yourself:

1. Obligation.
2. Time (vague terms such as “sometime next week” )
3. Goals and value. (distracted by another plan)
4. Mood, fear.

Conclusion: Our real distress comes from constant anxiety of delaying.

It is important to notice the healing system. But Why we procrastinate? Because we fear a threat to our independence.

The fear of judgment is the key fear that stems from over-identifying who you are.

**The critic: You can be with more energy and potential for movement, not just disgust with not perfect.**

Strict early family pattern is typical of many procrastinators.

You should know: life and work not just hard.
