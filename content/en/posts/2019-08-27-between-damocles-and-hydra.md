﻿#### HALF OF LIFE HAS NO NAME

The opposite of fragile is not robust, half of our life has no name for.

#### PLEASE BEHEAD ME

We need to become Hydra, the serpent-like creature, we need some doses of antifragility, otherwise the sword of Damocles will get you.

#### On the Necessity of Naming

In the history of human, so many names of colors didn&#8217;t created, but this doesn&#8217;t mean we cannot discern different colors. We are doing more than we think.

#### PROTO-ANTIFRAGILITY

Hormesis is the first way to become robustness or antifragility Which means we ingest small doses of poison gradually and make our body healthier. For a case, caloric restriction may lengthen our life expectancy.

#### DOMAIN INDEPENDENCE IS DOMAIN DEPENDENT

We, humans, are handicapped that we cannot translate the conceptions to another area we don&#8217;t know. So we should make efforts to make the concepts more easily understand.
