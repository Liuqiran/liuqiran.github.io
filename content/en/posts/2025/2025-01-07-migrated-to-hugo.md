After several days of painstaking work, I finally moved from WordPress to Hugo.

Due to the fact that my server is very slow, I think I can focus on writing offline and concentrate on content, rather than adjusting features.

There are many features that I find unnecessary, such as commentator ranking. The tree map of categories is also not that useful, because it’s hard to maintain the database. After switching to Hugo to manage my *posts*, I can organize them more easily.
