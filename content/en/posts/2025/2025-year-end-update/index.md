After several days of burning the midnight oil, I finally finished migrating my commenting system, adding custom buttons to my site, and implementing several other features.

The new commenting system, **Waline**, supports reactions and comes with a clean, elegant interface. I also added floating buttons at the bottom of each page—a table of contents button and a comment button—so visitors can quickly jump to the sections they want. 

If articles on different language websites have similar content, the comment sections will be merged together.

In addition, I updated the word-counting feature on the archive page. It now counts both the total number of articles and the total word count across the site.

I also found a better way to write and update articles on my phone. I initially wanted to use GitJournal, but it modifies the front matter, which caused my site builds to fail. Then I installed Termux and pulling the entire repository. For editing files, I  use **Markor**, a lightweight offline Markdown editor. It’s simple, reliable, and much more convenient for mobile writing going forward.

There are still features I’d like to implement—such as automatically publishing my posts to other platforms—but this has proven to be surprisingly difficult. I tried many approaches, but none worked well enough.

In the end, this process feels a lot like decorating my own small space. And I genuinely enjoy it.
