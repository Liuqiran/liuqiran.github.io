﻿#### Africa

What shall be my subject? -animals, but men are rare. They&#8217;re almost profiled because the only profile can show the essence.

#### Western Europe

Paleolithic human-headed shows that the ivory figure is very important for the artist.

Nude woman shows fertility images. The intents of makers maybe the female form.

Ancient artists always painted statuette.

The sculptors usually change the subject to keep the profile view and details.

#### Art in the Old Stone Age

The question is why painters want to paint in these cavern, some people believe that these bison can provide food for them.

Lascaux shows a hunting scene, it may be the first narrative art.
