</ol>

**Increased use of the Progressive Passive**  
**Increased usage** (19th c.): The ship is being built at&nbsp; Aberdeen.  
present progressive passive (present continuous passive)  
examples (current usage): first person singular: am + being + past participle I am being pranked.

**Decreased use of subjunctive after ‘if’ or ‘unless’**  
Present Subjunctive: be &#8211; ‘unless I be’  
Past Subjunctive: were &#8211; ‘if I were’  
Replaced with ‘am’ or ‘was’ &#8211; if I was’; / ‘unless I am’  
_Prospero: Unless I be relieved by prayer_  
**Current Usage: Subjunctive Mood** **(Conrad)**  
verb form, used for unreal, untrue, or&nbsp; hypothetical statements  
1. To express hopes/wishes: I wish I weren’t so shy.  
2. To express hypothetical situations: If I were taller, I could dunk a basketball.  
3. To express something that is untrue or unreal: He acts as if he were the one in charge.  
**Current Usage: Was (Conrad)**  
used for statements of fact example Last night, I was watching TV until midnight.

**Increased use of the split infinitive**  
infinitive: to + uninflected verb form example: to walk, to inflect, to split  
split infinitive: when an adverb or adverbial&nbsp; phrase appears between the to and the verb example:, to boldly go, to casually walk, to&nbsp; gently push  
**Current Usage: Split Infinitives (Grammarist)**  
now common in writing of all kinds; not a mistake when used appropriately  
1. Avoid split infinitives when moving the adverb to&nbsp; the end of a phrase doesn’t cause confusion or change the sentence’s meaning. example: split infinitive: He urged me to casually walk&nbsp; up and say hello. (unnecessary) infinitive: He urged me to walk up casually&nbsp; and say hello.  
2. Split infinitives when the adverb either needs&nbsp; emphasis or wouldn’t work anywhere else in the&nbsp; sentence.  
example: They’re expected to gradually come down in&nbsp; price to about $50 to $75 each.
