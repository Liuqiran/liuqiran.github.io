I have used a lot of software to store my notes and data. But gradually I found that although these softwares are very convenient and they offer a lot of good services. They also caused me a lot of trouble in the long run.  
One important reason is that you cannot export your data freely. I tried a lot of softwares after I decided to write online. Many of them don&#8217;t provide good export service. Your files can only be exported to some special formats. What&#8217;s more, these files can only be viewed in some special forms. We can probably convert them to other formats we want, but it&#8217;s not that easy.  
Another reason is that I realized that some tools and services could give you a lot of convenience and unique features, but when you get used to it. You are also limited by these tools. Your choice would be less, and it&#8217;s also very inconvenient if you want to change your tool. Especially for a person who is always curious about new tools. Technology is a double-edged sword. I always want to find a suitable tool for writing, learning, productivity, etc. But the result is not so good.

One day I read an [article][1] about plain text. I suddenly realized that we can do that too. We shouldn&#8217;t worry about the tools. What we can do is just go back to the content, to the medium itself. I can just focus on the words and the texts. I think that&#8217;s the easiest and best medium.

As for the format, I can choose the plain text, just like in this article. It&#8217;s very simple. Maybe I can do a lot of things only in plain text format. I don&#8217;t have to worry about the stability of software, and I can easily open plain text in a lot of software without worrying about the security of my personal data.
