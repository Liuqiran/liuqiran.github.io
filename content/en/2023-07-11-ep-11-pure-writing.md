Writing is a essential part in the life of thinking and learning. It&#8217;s also indispensible for me.  
But the way of writing has changed a lot. Writing on paper is the most traditional way.  
I can still vaguely remember the days when I was writing journal on paper under the dim light of lamp. I enjoyed the feeling of writing on paper.  
But it&#8217;s very inconvenient to write on paper. We can&#8217;t take all of our notebooks easily. It&#8217;s also difficult to look up former words.  
I started writing on note-taking apps in 2016. It&#8217;s really convenient and solved the former problems.  
There are a lot of features on noke-taking apps. We can change the style and font of notes. We can insert images, audios, even attachments of any format…  
But in recent years I realized I spent so much time on the features of the software. It created a lot of difficulties to saving and sharing. Another problem is that, note-taking app is installed on electronic devices. Phones and computers contains more features and notifcations. Now I think this way of writing also has its negative effect. It will create a lot of distractions.  
Recently I started writing in plain text. I can write in any note-taking softwares. Using special device for writing is also a good idea.

What&#8217;s more, I considered writing offline. Before I should always use online grammar checker when I was writing in English. Now I think it&#8217;s also a kind of distractions. Errors and misuses are inevitable. I also shouldn&#8217;t be perfect. Because it&#8217;s wiriting for myself. Why not write freely and purely?
