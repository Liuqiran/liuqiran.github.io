This is a love story between two teenagers, Mi-ran and Jun-Sang, although it happened in the most totalitarian country in the world&#8211;North Korea.

Mi-ran is a girl, her father is a miner, Jun-Sang is a student belongs to a family at a high level.

In the 1990s, the country&#8217;s economy broke down, and there is not enough electric power to keep the night be lighten, but the night in North Korea, it&#8217;s more natural and beautiful than other countries, no noises, no neons. What&#8217;s more, no one can spy the two teenagers, holding hands in the dark.
