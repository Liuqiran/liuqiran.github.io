Why do I no longer use stickers? For me, the use of stickers distorts the understanding of others. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an effective or appropriate way to communicate with others online. The Internet is already full of entertaining and useless information. Using stickers will make this situation worse. Using words is enough to convey accurate information. Although without stickers, some people will think that it will feel that there is no emotion. But the truth is that the Internet cannot emulate the real conversation. Calling and talking face to face may be a better way for communication.
