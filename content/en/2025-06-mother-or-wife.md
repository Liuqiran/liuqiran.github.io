Question: If both my mother and my wife fell into the water and I could only save one, who would you consider more important, and why?    

> Auntie: Of course it's your wife. Your wife is someone you chose, while your mother isn't someone you chose. You don't need to be responsible for choices made by others when you didn't even exist; but you must be responsible for your own choices. If you let your wife die, you would be breaking the vows you made at your wedding; conversely, you made no promises before you existed. This distinction must be clear as an adult.   

>Furthermore, I think if someone chooses to save their mother, it likely indicates they've been heavily influenced by their original family. Either their family or mother focused too much attention on the child, which is generally negative. Or perhaps subconsciously they lack confidence in building a new family, suggesting their relationship might fall apart when facing difficulties. If they haven't separated, it shows that their family has already put the child in first place.
