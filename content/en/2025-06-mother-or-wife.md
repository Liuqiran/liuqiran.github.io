Question: If both my mother and my wife fell into the water and I could only save one, who would you consider more important, and why?    

> Auntie: Of course it's your wife. Your wife is someone you chose, while your mother isn't someone you chose. You don't need to be responsible for choices made by others when you didn't even exist; but you must be responsible for your own choices. If you let your wife die, you would be breaking the vows you made at your wedding; conversely, you made no promises before you existed. This distinction must be clear as an adult.   

>Furthermore, I think if someone chooses to save their mother, it likely indicates they've been heavily influenced by their original family. Either their family or mother focused too much attention on the child, which is generally negative. Or perhaps subconsciously they lack confidence in building a new family, suggesting their relationship might fall apart when facing difficulties. If they haven't separated, it shows that their family has already put the child in first place.



For me personally, I now realize that if my father hadn’t chosen to put my mother first—if he hadn’t taken his wife and moved out of his parents’ home back then—my parents might have separated.

Perhaps one reason I left my hometown was that I wanted to get away from my mother and become an independent person. 

[I met someone who could give the right answer to this question](https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2025-06-general-santos-city/), but unfortunately, I couldn’t meet her standards. She can offer her life to the church, steadfast and serene, while I remain a restless soul, adrift in search of meaning.

Actually, this question should be asked by a woman, because I believe it is the woman who holds the right to choose and agree. But I sincerely hope that we all can meet someone who devotes himself to his wife, instead of his mother.
