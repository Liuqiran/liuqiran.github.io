Hello everyone. I&#8217;m Qiran. This is the first episode of my podcast. Today&#8217;s topic is that, I want to share reasons about why I start my podcast.

The first reason is, it&#8217;s a place of sharing my thoughts and my understanding covering a lot of topics. It&#8217;s an opportunity to exchange ideas with others, maybe I can meet new friends and learn a lot from others in the future.

Second, I think I can cover a lot of topics that I&#8217;m interested in. Forcing myself to write something is a good habit to learn, and it&#8217;ll also help me improve my thinking.

Third, it&#8217;s a good place to record my practice of speaking English. I can listen to my own voice and find my own problems of my speaking. I hope I&#8217;ll be able to upload a podcast regularly. It&#8217;s not only a practice for myself, but other people can also help me improve my English.

That&#8217;s all, I hope to continue in the future.
