There is a divine will guiding things in the unseen.

I'm lazy about going out, but if I hadn't suddenly decided to stroll that street in MOA that night, this story would never have begun.

I've never considered visiting another city just for entertainment. This time I bought the ticket, though expensive, to keep my promise to attend the Singles' camp.

I'm not much of a traveler, especially the hardships during trips. I still remember the good memory from when I was 8 years old, lying on the upper berth of the standard train heading south from my hometown. I watched moonlight shine on the white bed and saw tree shadows from rural areas sprinkle over the sandstone road and window. As the train started slowly, shadows moved behind slowly then sped up. Twinkling city lights faded away as the train left the Transfer City Station.

With flights, I can never feel that slow feeling of my childhood train journey. This time when I boarded the plane, it was daytime. I fell asleep, and when I woke, it was night. I was already in General Santos City, a southern city in the Philippines.

I was lucky to quickly get a taxi and meet a very kind driver after leaving the airport. His name is Solomon. I could feel his parents' expectations through his name. Though he wasn't good at expression and his English was worse than mine, he tried his best to communicate and introduce himself. He's from Mabuhay. He said he needs to work until 3 am, which stunned me. He explained he needs to pay his loan and tuition fee, and the car is rented. His ex used up all his money and left him - she drank and smoked despite claiming to be a believer. That's why he's already 30 years old and still unmarried. He said though everyone here is kind and friendly, he met bad people.     

After dropping my luggage, I headed directly to the college on Leslie's invitation. The road was uneven and dimly lit, with low buildings on both sides, but every shopfront was open. There were many motor tricycles, which are rare now in my hometown. After turning a quiet corner, I arrived and met them.

The first night, I watched the final activity of the Kids' camp. In just two days, these kids were trained for preaching from the KJV. They were divided into different groups and matched for drama performances. I was amazed, imagining what they were nurturing in this city - they were receiving excellent education.

The next morning, I visited Plaza Heneral Santos. This place was quite peaceful. I could hear the clock chiming on the hour. I felt a unique tranquility here.

I noticed local people like displaying their large portraits in public places for honor. I can't imagine doing that - I would be very embarrassed.

The seaside was close to the park. I walked there, seeing kids playing basketball and families sitting together. There were tourists too, whom I helped take photos.

In the afternoon, I walked around and visited a small restaurant (a shirt from Qingdao team...What exactly did people from Qingdao do wrong?).

On the 5th morning, the singles' camp began. I received my ID and schedule. Many people joined. I also met Miles and Christian, whom I'd met in SLC and who had been praying for me.

I visited room by room where children were nurtured, from infants just months old to toddlers of several years, all sorted into different rooms. Pastor Doug, the church's founder, left his hometown and took root in this city with his family. He devoted his life to his mission and this city. The theories I previously could only learn from books, I now witnessed firsthand: how a strong and stable community is built.

During lunch, Carmela asked if I was a vampire. I wished so, but I could feel my aging. Maybe I'm becoming a vampire sucking lots of supplements, haha. I noticed Dayla took 4 eggs for lunch - she told me it's low-carb diet. While I'm still struggling and arguing about what I should eat, I admired she is the first person I met with this dietary awareness in this far south city.

In the afternoon, we did painting with other groups.

In the evening, we played many games. One lady had to compete against one male from another team. I was matched with Aloha, though I wasn't really good at playing.

At night, there was an outdoor bonfire. Everyone could write a wish on paper and throw it into the bonfire. I'm not good at wishing and though I thought a lot, I could only write a few characters.

*Because I feel everything is already arranged, my only wish was: please don't follow my words or my prayers. If fate followed my wishes instead of Heaven's will, everything could be worse... Some things I can't understand or bear must have purposes beyond human comprehension. I can't even wish to understand these things, as not understanding is itself a protection.*

Services were conducted in Visayan. I met Jireson, who said he was introverted and always nervous talking with others. Though he claimed this, he was the one who approached me and helped translate topics intuitively - he was the friendliest person I met here. Faith supports him now, and that's what a real faithful soul looks like. It feels like a lost child finding their way home.

I had many conversations with Leslie. I told her that Jireson considered her one of the smartest girls here. Though she disagreed, she could answer questions very accurately and correctly. When she said "再见" , I really appreciated it. She was the  local I knew who could pop out many Chinese words. She gave me a letter, asking me to open it only after boarding the plane.

Three days went by so fast. I am one of the seeds dispersed from the dandelion, but what I already see is branches that have taken root and sprouted, growing into a forest. Until now, it's my best memory of life in the Philippines.

I thought I'd lost the letter because I was distributing pamphlets and rushing to board. I was searching through my bag when I found it had been tucked in the Book all along:
