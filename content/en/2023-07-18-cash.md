I bought a wallet and started using cash again recently.
It&#8217;s a very interesting try. I&#8217;ve been getting used to pay by smartphone for many years. It&#8217;s feeling weird after suddenly giving up E-pay. But now I found that I can still be relaxed when I going out without smartphone.
When I was paying, the feeling of &#8220;touching money&#8221; is very authentic. Compare with just tapping on the phone, I prefer the feeling of real money.
