A very thin, single-celled layer acts as a barrier between your gut and the outside world. The gut provides protection and absorbs 90% of all your nutrients. It also contains a layer of mucus, microbes, and 80% of your immune system.

Medical professionals often recommend increasing soluble fiber intake to repair leaky gut, but you should actually do the exact opposite. A carnivore diet is the best for leaky gut. More fiber can cause more inflammation.

Medical professionals also don't consider diet a cause or solution for leaky gut. Most diseases are triggered by what's in your gut, and this is closely related to your diet.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics can also affect gut health. Disrupting your gut microbiota can have serious consequences. You need the microbes in your gut to help you digest, and you don't want them to become disease-causing.

Glyphosate, a herbicide sprayed on most genetically modified and conventional foods, is patented as an antibiotic, so it has antibiotic effects on your body. Whole grains are also recommended, but they can severely damage leaky gut and trigger an immune response. Seed oils are another major contributor to leaky gut.


Here are seven signs of leaky gut:

Abdominal pain, cramps

Constipation, diarrhea

Fatigue

Brain fog

Mood problems, anxiety

Skin inflammation

Autoimmune disease

When you have an autoimmune response, your body treats normal tissue as foreign or pathogenic.

If your body treats your thyroid as an invader, your thyroid becomes inflamed. This is called Hashimoto's disease, and it begins with inflammation and leaky gut.

A carnivorous diet for several months can help repair leaky gut by removing foods that cause inflammation.

Glutamine and glycine can also help repair leaky gut.
