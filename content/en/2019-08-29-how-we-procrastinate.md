﻿#### CREATING SAFETY: THE FIRST MAJOR STEP OUT OF PROCRASTINATION

Imaging that we always transform the task to a board before ourself, we can perform well if this board is on the land, but if the board is suspended between two buildings 100 feet above the pavement, then we are fearful to pass it.What&#8217;s more, we always feel a fire behind ourself.

We always fell in self-criticism so we use procrastinate to put off tasks until the deadline. It&#8217;s a victim mentality that we think we have to, no we will.
