Several days ago I searched some pieces of music on Youtube and listening. when I&#8217;m listening to this music and saw the comments below. I&#8217;m very touched and weeping.

I haven’t `<g class="gr_ gr\_13 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="13" data-gr-id="13">`weeped`</g>` for a long time, remember that the last weep was two years ago.

I took a comment here:

    <g class="gr_ gr_110 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="110" data-gr-id="110">epicsoulfactory</g><br /> 3 years ago<br /> Hi, I’m Cesc Vilà, the composer of this track. <br /> I just wanted to let you know how important is for me to read all your beautiful comments. To read that someone can feel more relax or empowered and even that this music can help you a little bit to endure your struggle with <g class="gr_ gr_120 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="120" data-gr-id="120">depression,</g> is something that’s beyond what a composer could ask for and makes me feel a sense of purpose and a strength to move on with my life too. <br /> Sadly, sometimes we (myself) are <g class="gr_ gr_114 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="114" data-gr-id="114">knock</g> out by many <g class="gr_ gr_109 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="109" data-gr-id="109">cirumcustancies</g>…, and although we all know that <g class="gr_ gr_115 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="115" data-gr-id="115">eventually</g> things will pass, it’s really hard to move on. At such dark <g class="gr_ gr_116 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="116" data-gr-id="116">times</g> it is good to cling to what life gives to us…, it may be an idea, a dream, a song…, or even a series of warm comments in a video on <g class="gr_ gr_108 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="108" data-gr-id="108">you tube</g> (that’s the case). Anything goes to keep going on, to return back to our light.<br /> I just wanted to show you my gratitude and also encourage you all. Feel free to listen to my track Suns and Stars (Really Slow Motion). It’s there on <g class="gr_ gr_107 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="107" data-gr-id="107">you tube</g>. Not propaganda. I think that track really can help you also to feel empowered, uplifted and happy…, even if just makes you smile or dream for a second, it will be worthwhile 🙂<br /> Thanks also to HDSounDI for sharing my work. <br /> See you soon ^_^

    to everyone <g class="gr_ gr_12 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="12" data-gr-id="12">whom</g> is listening and feeling alone… you are in my prayers.<br /> never give up. life is precious. sending a ray of sunlight to everyone who needs it. I’ll be your friend, doesn’t matter who you are, who old o young you are, doesn’t matter what you look like or what religion or nationality you have. <br /> listen to the soft music: unable to perceive the shape of music, you find it all around you. <g class="gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="16" data-gr-id="16">it’s</g> presence fills your eyes with love. it humbles your heart, for <g class="gr_ gr_23 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="23" data-gr-id="23">it’s</g> everywhere xoxo Marit
