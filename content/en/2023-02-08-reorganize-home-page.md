<p class="has-primary-background-color has-background">

I haven't updated my status in a long time. I don't know when it happened, but I've lost the ability to express my feelings and the motivation to share...

</p>

Recently, I discovered that many functions were no longer working. It took a long time to fix them, otherwise this place would have been overgrown with weeds.

I've noticed many people are starting to use LinkTree as a personal homepage to aggregate numerous links. It seems these people are active on more and more social media platforms these days. They've lost count, so they use this website to organize them.

But isn't this just the function of a personal website homepage? You just add these links to your homepage, and you can customize the style and functions, avoiding the problem of everyone looking the same.

Besides, organizing your own homepage has other advantages: the URL is more concise and easier to remember; access is centralized on your own platform, not controlled by other platforms.

But regardless, it still needs regular maintenance. I should update my status more often.
