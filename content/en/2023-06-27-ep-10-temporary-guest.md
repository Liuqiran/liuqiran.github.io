Recently I was organizing my contact information. I found a lot of people I haven&#8217;t contacted in a long time. As time goes by, they disappear from my life and never reappear. It&#8217;s as if they died even though I have their information. Each of them is like a temporary guest. I don&#8217;t know if there will be a chance for us to meet in the future.

I&#8217;m gradually able to start a new relationship. But at the moment I still don&#8217;t have the ability to reconnect with old people, but I&#8217;m trying my best. I feel that many people don&#8217;t have this ability because of embarrassment. We just let these relationships die one by one. I don&#8217;t want to be isolated, so to avoid that situation, I also have to overcome my fear.

I know that it&#8217;s up to me to reconnect. Only if I take action first and say hello to them, can we continue our story.
