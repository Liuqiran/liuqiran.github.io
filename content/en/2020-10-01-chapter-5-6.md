﻿### The Toltec path to freedom {.wp-block-heading}

Awareness, transformation and intent are three masteries that lead people to become Toltecs.  
**Death is a angel**, teaches us live everyday as if it is the last day of our lives.

### The New Dream {.wp-block-heading}

**Heaven on Earth**  
I WANT YOU TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU HAVE. Use our imagination, and your emotions to dream heaven.

**Prayers**  
We can be a prayer for love, a prayer for freedom.
