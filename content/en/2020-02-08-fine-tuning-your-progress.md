**PLANNED SETBACKS**  
You can try to plan procrastination when you meet a big project, and record your self-statement, these statements may be your old pattern.

### RESILIENCE AND HARDINESS {.wp-block-heading}

**Resilience**  
Resilience is very important when you fail, every time you fail you can bounce back from it and know your performance isn&#8217;t your self-worth, but your performance is connected to your perseverance. You don&#8217;t need to be responsible for what had happened to you, but you need to be responsible for how to tackle these problems. Sarah&#8217;s experience told us that you will meet some obstacles placed by others, but you don&#8217;t need to put these pressure on yourself, you just need to set a time for yourself and see how much you can finish.

### MENTAL REHEARSAL AND PREPROGRAMMING {.wp-block-heading}

You can use mental rehearsal and reprogram a mental image to visualize the project you need to finish. In this chapter, Martha imaged her project as a big, thick wall. But she visualized it as defensive protection, to protect her from other criticism.

### EFFECTIVE GOAL-SETTING {.wp-block-heading}

As a producer, you need to know which goal you can wholeheartedly pursue and which goal you just let go of. Like the reading book, I need to choose a realistic book and don&#8217;t change until I finished, because when I read several books in the same period, I will feel exhausted and nervous. I need to try to read one book and stick with it.

### Avoiding Setbacks {.wp-block-heading}

The reason for hesitating go set goals usually is we fear the setback. There are some steps to avoid setbacks:  
Step 1:**Recognize the work of procrastinating.** I must know the guilty of procrastination is also a form of work, it is a choice I cannot avoid to choose.  
Step 2: **Freely choose the entire goal.** Which part of a goal when you want to choose first? Don&#8217;t need to be nagging, _Eating the frog_ is one of the most effective habits.  
Step 3: **Create functional, observable goals.** Set your subgoals.
