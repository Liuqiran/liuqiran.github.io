Pain to power; Helplessness to choice; Depression to Energy; Paralysis to action;

It&#8217;s a power of love yourself, power of good love.

love and power go together.

pain+&#8212;&#8211;+&#8212;&#8212;+power

I&#8217;m powerful and I am loved.

Action is very powerful!

Don&#8217;t be too serious! (Don&#8217;t be as my dad)

&#8220;I hope&#8221; is a pain. You are not a victim, you just need to say &#8220;I know&#8221;.

If you are responsible for your faults, then you can avoid it the next time.

&#8220;It&#8217;s a problem&#8221; is another deading phrase, why not see it as an opportunity?

So take some risk before going to bed at night.

You deserve an exciting life!
