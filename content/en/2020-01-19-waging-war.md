﻿_故兵聞拙速，未睹巧之久也。_  
If you exposed a war too long, even you are ingenious, you will make a mistake. leave a little to your opponent.

_力屈，財襌（殫），中原內需於家，百姓之費，十去其七_  
Waging a war, you need to forage on your enemy.

_故殺敵者, 怒也;取敵之利者, 貨也_&nbsp;Kill your enemy from the power generated by your anger, get benefits from your foe.
