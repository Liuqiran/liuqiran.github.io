﻿Last week I went through a serious problem of my server, on which my website runs.  
It started with the problem of the version of PHP. The edition of the current PHP is very old and it couldn&#8217;t support the running of some plugins. Then I tried to install a new version of PHP, but it didn&#8217;t work. When I tried to uninstall the old version, the server crashed and could not be restarted due to an error called &#8220;kernel panic&#8221;.  
I&#8217;ve done my best to fix it myself until midnight. It&#8217;s useless. I could only ask other people for help. The technical staff couldn&#8217;t solve it either, but they helped me to backup the data. It&#8217;s a very tedious experience and I could restore my server after several days. Finally, I used the backup data and restored my website.

Now I feel that there are a lot of problems I cannot do by myself, what I can only do is find the help from some professional persons. But it&#8217;s my hobby to explore some technical stuff. It&#8217;s very interesting. It reminds me of the days when I created my first blog when I was only 8 years old. It made me very excited.

After a period of time when I started this website, I didn&#8217;t know the usefulness of building a website. It was built entirely out of my own passion. Sometimes I was in the situation of self-doubt. But I still hope that it will give me some benefits in the future. Because I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time on building the website, I can feel that my skill is growing. Now I realized that it&#8217;s really an interest of mine. Why not just continue. In this field of website building, there are a lot of things I need to learn.
