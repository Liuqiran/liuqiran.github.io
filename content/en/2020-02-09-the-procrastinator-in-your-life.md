#### MANAGING PEOPLE WHO PROCRASTINATE {.wp-block-heading}

Due to procrastination, employees lose their productivities and cause companies billions of dollars lost.

#### COMMITMENT VS. COMPLIANCE {.wp-block-heading}

As a manager, you need to use inviting commitment rather than demands for compliance.

#### FOCUSING ON STARTING VS. FINISHING {.wp-block-heading}

Effective managers always have the ability to communicate with their employees. Focusing on starting is much more effective for a perfectionist.

#### GETTING RESULTS OR GIVING CRITICISM {.wp-block-heading}

You need to give praise instead of criticism for employees. Praise even needs to precede the recommendations for improvement.  
**State Your Priorities Clearly**  
Don&#8217;t change your priority too often.  
**Be Decisive**  
You need to be decisive and don&#8217;t change the goal during the project. When you choose one, don&#8217;t change it.  
**Be Fair and Frequent in Your Rewards**  
Craving to be appreciated is a deep need in human nature.  
**LIVING WITH A PROCRASTINATOR**  
Maybe you are living with a procrastinator, you didn&#8217;t need to put commands do them, just say I would instead of you should.  
**A LAST WORD**  
Go ahead! Don&#8217;t say I&#8217;ll try or it&#8217;s not working, just be open-minded and do it!
