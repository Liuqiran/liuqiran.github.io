High levels are abstract. People alway want to go higher level thinking. 

Shifting to low levels has two benefits, the first is people can avoid the control of high levels, the second is, people escape from strong emotions like anxiety.

People usually change between high levels and low levels.

Self-awareness can occurs at different levels, at low levels, like pain and movement.

Self-worth is very important if they cannot justify their actions and feel progress for their goals, self-worth will be very low.

#### Masochism as Life-Scheme  {.wp-block-heading}
