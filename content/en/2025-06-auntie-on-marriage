The so-called conflict between traditional society and modern society is actually a conflict between Christian society and modern society. What we call modern society's features were actually commonplace in pre-modern non-Christian societies. Progressive/leftist culture spreads to non-Christian societies with much less resistance than to Christian societies. For example, homosexuality was never an issue in Confucian society, transgender people have existed since ancient times in the Philippines, Thailand and Southeast Asia, liberal marriage and sexual liberation with no-fault divorce was more prevalent in the Roman Empire than in the modern West, and cross-species identification and marriage frequently appeared in African and worldwide primitive tribes.

From a Christian apologist's perspective, only Christian marriage is a sacrament. Church weddings, like coronation ceremonies, guarantee feudal freedoms for both husband/patriarch and wife/children/subjects. Honor sacrifice, proud obedience, generous trust, contractual rights, habits of freedom, honesty and courage - all grow from the details of daily life. So-called modern culture is merely pagan culture in disguise making a comeback, reducing wives to prostitutes living in doomed vicious competition of using sex to please others, inevitably losing most sense of honor and responsibility. Children become no different from orphans or illegitimate children, living in arbitrary violent uncertainty, forced to develop habits of lying, becoming familiar with the weaker's cunning betrayal and viciousness from childhood. Men gain freedom of desire and power without responsibility, inevitably developing tyrannical habits in private life, which then extend to society at large, producing a corrupt society where the strong are arbitrary and the weak are base.
