**Practice: leave your phone at home**  
Having your phone is not a crisis.

**Practice: Take long walks**  
Walking is better than sedentary. &#8220;If you&#8217;re wearing headphones, you are not really walking.&#8221;  
But the hardest part of this practice is making the time.  
Broaden your definition of &#8220;good weather&#8221;! You can get big rewards.

**Practice: Write letter to yourself**  
_It&#8221;s a simple and easy practice to to deploy, but it&#8217;s also inscredibly effective._

When you are do nothing, the default work is still working. It seems to be connected to social cognition.

**The social animal**  
We are social animals, but the new digital communication tools made us much larger and much less local, and it has caused problems.

**The social media paradox**  
It&#8217;s weird that social media makes you feel both connected and lonely, happy and sad.  
_Where we want to be cautious&#8230;is when the sound of a voice or a cup of coffee with a friend is replaced with &#8216;likes&#8217; on a post._

**Reclaiming conversation**  
In the philosophy of&nbsp;_conversation-centric communcation_&nbsp;, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. It&#8217;s a supporter.  
_&#8230;text is no longer a sufficient alternatives._  
In my opinion, conversation-centric activities need us to outputting instead of receiving information.

**Practice: Don&#8217;t click &#8220;like&#8221;**  
Not only should you stop using the &#8220;like&#8221; button, but also you need remain silent and sop leaving comments.

**Practice: Consolidate texting**  
The practice of consolidating texting will upgrade the nature of your relationships.  
You will not check your text messages occasionally. When other people need you urgently, they can always call you .

**Practice: Hold conversation office hours**  
Like consolidate texting, you can set up a office hours to have a real conversation with other people.
