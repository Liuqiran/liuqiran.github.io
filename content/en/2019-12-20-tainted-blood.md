In this chapter, the author introduced the families of Mi-ran and Jun-sang, Mi-ran&#8217;s father is a warrior from South Korea and he was captive by North army, he was forced to be a miner in Chojin (that town in northeastern), but he never told this to his daughters and son, until this tainted blood effects their life.

Jun-sang&#8217;s family is from Japan, they are wealthy as Japanese-Korean. when Korea divided, some Japanese-Korean thought the North government is better than South as a group battled with Japanese, so they went to North, but after the regime formed, they noticed everything changed, Kim Il-sung, never believe them, they were purged because God Kim didn&#8217;t allow them to be wealthier than common North Korea people and to connect their relatives in Japan. They couldn&#8217;t go back to Japan forever.
