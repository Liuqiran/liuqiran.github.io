Hi, I&#8217;m Qiran. Today I would like to share with you my understanding of fear.

Fear is one of the basic human emotions. We all have fears. As for me, fear is one of my biggest difficulties in life.

There are different kinds of fear.  
The first fear of myself is the fear of being disappointed by others. In terms of human relationships, I&#8217;m really an infant now. I am afraid of falling.  
I always avoid dealing with others, just like an infant avoids learning to walk. But if I never fall down, I cannot learn to walk forever.  
I knew I had to accept disappointments. Maybe I&#8217;m able to collect them in order to develop my abilities. I don&#8217;t have to take them personally. Disappointments are actually assets.

The second fear is the fear of failure. I&#8217;m so afraid that I&#8217;m afraid to try new things. But only by trying to get new experiences can I get better. If I can fail more, I can get more experience. If I can get more experience, I&#8217;ll be able to get more success.

The third fear of myself is the fear of success. Why is success also a kind of fear? Fear of failure is quite normal. But fear of success is another form of it. Because I don&#8217;t think I have the ability to accept success, even when success is right in front of me. I always flinch until I feel safe.

Any kind of fear is the fence of life. What I have to do is feel the fear and do it anyway. Taking action is so important. I cannot just live in my dream. Why not take the first step?

That&#8217;s all. That&#8217;s my understanding of fear.
