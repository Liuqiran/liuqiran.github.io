Hi, I&#8217;m Qiran. Today I would like to share with you some of my understanding about habits.  
In my life, the concept of cultivating habits is gradually becoming one of the most important parts.

In my opinion, habit is a compound interest. The fruits or effects of habits will grow faster and faster in the long run.

For me, one of the examples of daily habit is writing journals. Maybe it&#8217;s my longest habit, which started from my middle school time. Now it has become my important habit that records my life.

Another habit is using Anki. Anki is a memorization software. I can create my own cards to review words. I&#8217;ve used Anki for many years. It also motivates me to learn new words on a regular basis.

It&#8217;s like a tree. Now I gradually realized that creating habits is similar to growing branches and leaves. If you want to cultivate a tree, you need a good environment and soil. You have to cultivate it carefully and water it every day.  
If I repeat my habits, some of them will have more and more effects, I will know that I can find out my rough direction. Now I can grow new habits based on old habits. On the contrary, I can find bad habits and try to cut them down.  
I&#8217;m the sum of my own habits. Now I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a problem to set a goal that creates more and more habits.

That&#8217;s all, that&#8217;s my understanding of habits.
