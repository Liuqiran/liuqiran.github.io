If you see your work insatiable and infinite, you fell into a negative mind.

**THE IMPORTANCE OF PLAY**

Play can make us more effective, more creative, producers have more time to play than procrastinators.

We need to know that play is important, through recreation and playing we get creativity. So in order to improve efficiency we need to spend time to play. We need plan for some time to play, producers always living without stressing about don&#8217;t finish the project.

**THE PULL METHOD OF SELF-MOTIVATION**

In order to get to qualify work, you need to find something you really love to, it&#8217;s recreation or something you really enjoy in your task, I think U can break tasks to small pieces then find interesting part in them. But all in all, you need to plan for your recreation.

**FROM GUILT-FREE PLAY TO QUALITY WORK**

Combining play and work, it&#8217;s our inner fire, a mission to become harmony in our life, not goals, not tasks. playing gives you creativy to pursuit your own mission!
