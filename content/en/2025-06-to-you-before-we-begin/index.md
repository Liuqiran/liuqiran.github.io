Dear You,

We haven’t met yet, or perhaps we have — quietly, without knowing what we might become.

In this generation, many no longer believe in first love, in waiting, in forever. I’ve often been told I’m too idealistic, too slow, too serious. But I know whom I’m waiting for: someone who believes, like I do, that love isn’t just a feeling — it’s a covenant.

Maybe you’re quiet too. Maybe you write more than you speak, pray more than you post. You may feel deeply, but share sparingly — because you treasure what’s real. Maybe you’ve chosen to wait, even when the world keeps telling you not to.

People sometimes ask me why I insist on waiting — why not just try, see what happens, and “learn from experience”?  
But I believe the way we begin shapes everything that follows.  
To give myself fully, for the first and only time, to someone who has also guarded her heart — that is not weakness, but strength.  
I’m not afraid of loneliness. I’m afraid of giving pieces of my soul to places they don’t belong.

That’s why I’ve chosen to wait. Not out of fear, but out of hope.  
Not because I idealize romance, but because I honor what love was meant to be: exclusive, holy, enduring.

If you were here, I would want to do the simple things with you — not the grand, but the real:  
Mornings with prayer and Scripture, evenings cooking together,  
Holding hands during silence instead of rushing to fill it,  
Loving in quiet faithfulness when words run out.

I don’t expect you to be perfect.  
In fact, what I long for is someone who’s honest about their fears,  
someone whose gentleness doesn’t come from weakness but from understanding pain.

If you are the kind of person who notices things others miss —  
the way light falls on a quiet street,  
the mood behind a friend's tired smile,  
the unspoken meaning behind the words I never say —  
then you may be closer to me than I think.

I don’t know when or where our paths will cross.  
But when they do — and if you are the one I’ve been preparing for —  
I will recognize you, not just with my eyes, but with a heart that has been trained to discern.  
I won’t hesitate. I’ll pursue with clarity, and I will fight for the future we’re meant to build.

Until that day, I will keep growing, keep praying,  
and keep becoming the kind of man who will be ready to love you well.

May God guard your heart — and mine —  
until the day we begin this story together.
