    Habits are the compound interest. Your habits can compound for you or against you.

    <strong>Positive Compounding</strong>: Productivity compounds; knowledge compounds; relationship compounds.<br /><strong>Nagative compounding</strong>: Stress compounds; negative thoughts compound; outrage compounds.

Some stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, they will compound into serious health issues.

The most powerful outcomes are delayed! You just need keep going!

**Forget about goals, focus on systems instead**  
Problem #1:Winners and losers have the same goals.  
Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.  
Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.  
So, why you just restrict your goal, instead of enjoying with it? Such as my homework, I can just set a goal I want.  
Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.  
*True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking.  
So, when you cannot change your habits, the problem often is your system instead of yourself.
