Based on the recommendation from Rich Dad&#8217;s book, I try to install the Cashflow game. But the desktop version of E-Game is difficult to install now. I tried my best to install it successfully in VirtualBox. 

For the past few months, I have been playing the Cashflow 101 e-game. I have gradually become proficient at it. It&#8217;s very educational and I&#8217;ve gained some knowledge about cash. These days I started to try Cashflow 202. It&#8217;s more complicated compared to the 101 edition.
