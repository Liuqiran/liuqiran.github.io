I also feel lonely last week, but I walked out recently.  
I&#8217;m sorry to hear that you didn&#8217;t live with your parents üôÅ  
I think maybe it&#8217;s the reason you still struggling against loneliness.  
In the book &#8216;Becoming human&#8217;, belonging is very important, we need belongings.  
I&#8217;m so sorry my language is not very well? but I&#8217;m willing to hear your stories, through words, I hope we can build a good friendship ?

Have a good day
