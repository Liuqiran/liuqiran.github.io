Due to procrastination, employees lose their productivities and cause companies billions of dollars lost.
COMMITMENT VS. COMPLIANCE
As a manager, you need to use inviting commitment rather than demands for compliance.
FOCUSING ON STARTING VS. FINISHING
Effective managers always have the ability to communicate with their employees. Focusing on starting is much more effective for a perfectionist.
GETTING RESULTS OR GIVING CRITICISM
You need to give praise instead of criticism for employees. Praise even needs to precede the recommendations for improvement.
State Your Priorities Clearly
Don’t change your priority too often.
Be Decisive
You need to be decisive and don’t change the goal during the project. When you choose one, don’t change it.
Be Fair and Frequent in Your Rewards
Craving to be appreciated is a deep need in human nature.
LIVING WITH A PROCRASTINATOR
Maybe you are living with a procrastinator, you didn’t need to put commands do them, just say I would instead of you should.
A LAST WORD
Go ahead! Don’t say I’ll try or it’s not working, just be open-minded and do it!"><meta name=author content="Qiran"><link rel=canonical href=https://liuqiran.github.io/the-procrastinator-in-your-life/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d72444526d7ecbdb0015438a7fa89054a658bf759d0542e2e5df81ce94b493ee.css integrity="sha256-1yREUm1+y9sAFUOKf6iQVKZYv3WdBULi5d+BzpS0k+4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://liuqiran.github.io/the-procrastinator-in-your-life/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://liuqiran.github.io/the-procrastinator-in-your-life/"><meta property="og:title" content="THE PROCRASTINATOR IN YOUR LIFE"><meta property="og:description" content="MANAGING PEOPLE WHO PROCRASTINATE Due to procrastination, employees lose their productivities and cause companies billions of dollars lost.
