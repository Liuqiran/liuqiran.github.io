Today I would like to share with you my understanding of fear.
Fear is one of the basic human emotions. We all have fears. As for me, fear is one of my biggest difficulties in life.
There are different kinds of fear.
The first fear of myself is the fear of being disappointed by others. In terms of human relationships, I’m really an infant now. I am afraid of falling.
I always avoid dealing with others, just like an infant avoids learning to walk. But if I never fall down, I cannot learn to walk forever.
I knew I had to accept disappointments. Maybe I’m able to collect them in order to develop my abilities. I don’t have to take them personally. Disappointments are actually assets."><meta name=author content="Qiran"><link rel=canonical href=https://liuqiran.github.io/ep-3-feel-the-fear/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d72444526d7ecbdb0015438a7fa89054a658bf759d0542e2e5df81ce94b493ee.css integrity="sha256-1yREUm1+y9sAFUOKf6iQVKZYv3WdBULi5d+BzpS0k+4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://liuqiran.github.io/ep-3-feel-the-fear/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://liuqiran.github.io/ep-3-feel-the-fear/"><meta property="og:title" content="EP 3 Feel the fear"><meta property="og:description" content="Hi, I’m Qiran.
