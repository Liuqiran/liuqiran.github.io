In order to gain our skill or improve our ability, we all need to have enough practice.
Practice is repeated action. Enough times of repetition is necessary in our life. If we do a lot of practice, we will definitely get some improvements unconsciously.
In most cases, the beginning of the practice is very difficult. We think it’s hard, it’s a big challenge. We may have tried many times, but there are still no results at all. We want to give up. But if we continue and persevere, as the times of practice increase, our improvement will be faster and faster. This is a phenomenon that shows up in many areas. The problem is that we give up so easily."><meta name=author content="Qiran"><link rel=canonical href=/ep-7-practice/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d72444526d7ecbdb0015438a7fa89054a658bf759d0542e2e5df81ce94b493ee.css integrity="sha256-1yREUm1+y9sAFUOKf6iQVKZYv3WdBULi5d+BzpS0k+4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=/ep-7-practice/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="/ep-7-practice/"><meta property="og:title" content="EP 7 Practice"><meta property="og:description" content="Practice is one of the most important things in our life.
