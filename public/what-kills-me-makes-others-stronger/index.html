Some parts on the inside of a system may be required to be fragile in order to make the system antifragile as a result. All restaurants are combating with each other in order to form the antifragility of the whole group. If a single restaurant is too robust when the crisis happens, all reasons are boil down to the fragile of this restaurant.
Evolution and Unpredictability
Nature (and nature-like systems) likes diversity between organisms rather than diversity within an immortal organism…
Evolutions benefits from the randomness but the unit died from the harms.
So I need to build some new systems different than the habit system, such as an energy managing system or log system."><meta name=author content="Qiran"><link rel=canonical href=https://liuqiran.github.io/what-kills-me-makes-others-stronger/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d72444526d7ecbdb0015438a7fa89054a658bf759d0542e2e5df81ce94b493ee.css integrity="sha256-1yREUm1+y9sAFUOKf6iQVKZYv3WdBULi5d+BzpS0k+4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://liuqiran.github.io/what-kills-me-makes-others-stronger/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://liuqiran.github.io/what-kills-me-makes-others-stronger/"><meta property="og:title" content="What Kills Me Makes Others Stronger"><meta property="og:description" content="Antifragility by layers Some parts on the inside of a system may be required to be fragile in order to make the system antifragile as a result.
