People alway want to go higher level thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shifting to low levels has two benefits, the first is people can avoid the control of high levels, the second is, people escape from strong emotions like anxiety.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People usually change between high levels and low levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Self-awareness can occurs at different levels, at low levels, like pain and movement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Self-worth is very important if they cannot justify their actions and feel progress for their goals, self-worth will be very low.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Masochism and sadism</title><link>https://liuqiran.com/en/2019-07-17-masochism-and-sadism/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2019 06:39:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://liuqiran.com/en/2019-07-17-masochism-and-sadism/</guid><description>&lt;p>In Freud’s theory, masochism is from sadism, another theory said that sadism and masochism are two faces of one coin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the recent study shows that maybe masochism is more fundamental. The number of Masochists are much more than sadists’.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The submissive partners are really in control during SM, because it is the submissive’s desire shapes the sex play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Masochistic desires are much stronger than sadistic. But many submissive people cannot find a partner to dominate them because of the shortage. So What happens often is two masochists meet each other, one of them should take turns.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
