&lt;li>
Taking responsibility means never blaming anyone else for anything you are being, doing, having, or feeling.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
Taking responsibility means not blaming yourself.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
Taking responsibility means being aware of where and when you are NOT taking responsibility so that you can eventually change.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
Taking responsibility means handling the Chatterbox.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
Taking responsibility means being aware of payoffs that keep you “stuck.” (Don&amp;#8217;t think &amp;#8220;if only&amp;#8221;)

&lt;p>It’s a power of love yourself, power of good love.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>love and power go together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>pain+—–+——+power&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m powerful and I am loved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Action is very powerful!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don’t be too serious! (Don’t be as my dad)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I hope” is a pain. You are not a victim, you just need to say “I know”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are responsible for your faults, then you can avoid it the next time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
