&lt;p&gt;Writing is a essential part in the life of thinking and learning. It’s also indispensible for me.&lt;br&gt;
But the way of writing has changed a lot. Writing on paper is the most traditional way.&lt;br&gt;
I can still vaguely remember the days when I was writing journal on paper under the dim light of lamp. I enjoyed the feeling of writing on paper.&lt;br&gt;
But it’s very inconvenient to write on paper. We can’t take all of our notebooks easily. It’s also difficult to look up former words.&lt;br&gt;
I started writing on note-taking apps in 2016. It’s really convenient and solved the former problems.&lt;br&gt;
There are a lot of features on noke-taking apps. We can change the style and font of notes. We can insert images, audios, even attachments of any format…&lt;br&gt;
But in recent years I realized I spent so much time on the features of the software. It created a lot of difficulties to saving and sharing. Another problem is that, note-taking app is installed on electronic devices. Phones and computers contains more features and notifcations. Now I think this way of writing also has its negative effect. It will create a lot of distractions.&lt;br&gt;
Recently I started writing in plain text. I can write in any note-taking softwares. Using special device for writing is also a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Master said to Yan Yuan, “If I’m employed, I’ll show my talent; If not, I’ll hide my light under a bushel, only you and I have the ability to do it!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zi Lu said, “If you lead troops, whom do you want to work with you?” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Master Said, “If someone attacks a tiger unarmed or crosses a river without a boat, and he died without any regret, I would not work with him. What I need definitely is someone who is careful and fond of making plans for success.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
