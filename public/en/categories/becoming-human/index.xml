      <description>&lt;p&gt;The author thinks we cannot just live alone, we need to have a belonging, but maybe love other people is hurt other people’s freedom. What’s more, we think we are in a group or a community, we can feel we are superior than others. we all need help, but sometimes we always hide this and think we are better than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to think we are superior to others, we build walls, make our group against other groups, prejudice cultivates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The author got some experiences which saw so many disabilities, they full of loneliness, painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A human being needs a companion, and we need truths and make our worlds or communities better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;community-and-rigid-order&#34;&gt;Community and Rigid Order&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paradox between the desire to belong, to fit in a community and to serve the deepest mind for oneself, close to God and be freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;the-weakness-of-a-child&#34;&gt;The Weakness of a Child&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all born with weakness, we need love from parents as we cannot survive without others help. So if we don’t get love from the outside world, we will feel lonely. A lonely child will construct protection to survive and close his heart, but a child who gets love will more open to the world. we all have a lonely child in our heart, a lonely child can make us survive but also can destruct us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
