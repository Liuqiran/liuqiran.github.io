      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the recommendation from Rich Dad’s book, I try to install the Cashflow game. But the desktop version of E-Game is difficult to install now. I tried my best to install it successfully in VirtualBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I have been playing the Cashflow 101 e-game. I have gradually become proficient at it. It’s very educational and I’ve gained some knowledge about cash. These days I started to try Cashflow 202. It’s more complicated compared to the 101 edition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I browsed many articles about free software, especially &lt;a href=&#34;https://tech.sina.cn/it/2014-05-27/detail-iavxeafs2072085.d.html?from=wap&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, Stallman is sort of extreme, why I always care about extremely security and privacy too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not an extreme person in any topic, I need to have my life and my own goal, but because of my personality, I stick to some thinking that makes me different from others, in the end, it doesn’t make me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dreams(like become a native speaker or improve my skill and knowledge reserve very fast) are building in the air, not in the reality, why I cannot enjoy the road?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
