I definitely know Austria.&lt;br>
You can find out more about me on my personal website. By the way, why not leave a footprint there?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s great that you’re interested in learning a language. It’s a long way for learning something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, it is. I’m Qiran. Nice to meet you!&lt;/p>

I’m sorry to hear that you didn’t live with your parents 🙁&lt;br>
I think maybe it’s the reason you still struggling against loneliness.&lt;br>
In the book ‘Becoming human’, belonging is very important, we need belongings.&lt;br>
I’m so sorry my language is not very well? but I’m willing to hear your stories, through words, I hope we can build a good friendship ?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
