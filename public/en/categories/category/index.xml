The most important decision you&amp;#8217;ll ever make: Change your categories.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lack of willingness to change your categories is dogmatic, and your categories become chains that restrict your growth. On the other hand, your categories may change so wildly that they become meaningless and without something to anchor you, you fall into an endless abyss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align:left">
Perhaps, the most important category you&amp;#8217;ll construct is one of yourself.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every category you impose one the world is one that you also impose on yourself and you decide if you do or donâ€™t fit into that category.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
