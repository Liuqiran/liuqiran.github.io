      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was organizing my contact information. I found a lot of people I haven’t contacted in a long time. As time goes by, they disappear from my life and never reappear. It’s as if they died even though I have their information. Each of them is like a temporary guest. I don’t know if there will be a chance for us to meet in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m gradually able to start a new relationship. But at the moment I still don’t have the ability to reconnect with old people, but I’m trying my best. I feel that many people don’t have this ability because of embarrassment. We just let these relationships die one by one. I don’t want to be isolated, so to avoid that situation, I also have to overcome my fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
