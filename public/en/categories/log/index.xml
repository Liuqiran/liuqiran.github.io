My writing speed is faster than before. The problem is that I face some stress when I need to post publicly. I’m still afraid of showing the errors and flaws of my article.&lt;br>
But I know no one can be perfect. Modifying the article and checking the grammar incessantly will kill the interest and motivation of writing.&lt;br>
In addition, It’s my own website. I think if other people don’t like, they can unfollow me.&lt;br>
In any case, I will try our best to practice more and share my thoughts which I think valuable.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
