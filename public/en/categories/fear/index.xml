Today I would like to share with you my understanding of fear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fear is one of the basic human emotions. We all have fears. As for me, fear is one of my biggest difficulties in life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are different kinds of fear.&lt;br>
The first fear of myself is the fear of being disappointed by others. In terms of human relationships, I’m really an infant now. I am afraid of falling.&lt;br>
I always avoid dealing with others, just like an infant avoids learning to walk. But if I never fall down, I cannot learn to walk forever.&lt;br>
I knew I had to accept disappointments. Maybe I’m able to collect them in order to develop my abilities. I don’t have to take them personally. Disappointments are actually assets.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
