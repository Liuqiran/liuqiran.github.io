So if we don’t buy, we are “wrong”, but if we buy, we are still “wrong”. Because of that, we need to think about serials new questions about money and consume, we need transformation.\nThe Beginning of a new road map for money Patterns of Belief: There are so many superstitions that we believe, from childhood (if the mother leaves the door ajar the snake will be banished) to adulthood (expose to germs will catch a cold), our brain is pattern making, but most of them can be changed.\nWhat Do Our Actions Say?: We always try to buy something to solve our problem, like now, I bought Dongfang Shuye but avoid washing my bottle (it is stinky because I didn’t wash it for several days with a teabag)\nThe Fulfillment Curve: Once you know it is enough, the fulfillment curve changed direction.\nClutter—A Fate Worse Than Dearth: If anything is excess for you, you are going to get clutter.

When you think something needs to buy, but just because of commercial propaganda effects you make you think it’s your self-fulfillment, but this kind of self-fulfillment is fake.\nFaces and Functions of Clutter: There are so many things are cluttering, you will find it everywhere. Noises, meaningless activities, in your environment. Once you notice them, you will make your own definition of clutter, and clean them intentionally. Now you can follow these 9 steps.\nStep 1: Making Peace with the Past You don’t need to follow the first steps right now, you can read them or read all of this book and practice this step.\nA. HOW MUCH HAVE YOU EARNED IN YOUR LIFE? You need to dig out your all logs of your financial income. As possible as you can, don’t miss any details.\nThe Value of Step 1: You will make clear how much money you earned and eradicates some illusions like “I can earn lots of money” or “I can’t earn lots of money.”\nNo Shame, no blame. You need to repeat this mantra, the money you make is just a number, you needn’t feel sad about it or gloating because your friends made less.\nB. What have you got to show for it?
