RESILIENCE AND HARDINESS
Resilience
Resilience is very important when you fail, every time you fail you can bounce back from it and know your performance isn’t your self-worth, but your performance is connected to your perseverance. You don’t need to be responsible for what had happened to you, but you need to be responsible for how to tackle these problems. Sarah’s experience told us that you will meet some obstacles placed by others, but you don’t need to put these pressure on yourself, you just need to set a time for yourself and see how much you can finish."><meta name=author content="Qiran"><link rel=canonical href=https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2020-02-08-fine-tuning-your-progress/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=../../assets/css/stylesheet.c2e1bd478cc2eea84094c5021c2951d3c83ca4abe3ad21dac5602603eb5dcf19.css integrity="sha256-wuG9R4zC7qhAlMUCHClR08g8pKvjrSHaxWAmA+tdzxk=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2020-02-08-fine-tuning-your-progress/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://chinese-fonts-cdn.deno.dev/packages/jhlst/dist/%E4%BA%AC%E8%8F%AF%E8%80%81%E5%AE%8B%E4%BD%93v2_002/result.css><link rel=stylesheet href=../../fonts/Garamond.css><meta property="og:url" content="https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2020-02-08-fine-tuning-your-progress/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Liu Qiran"><meta property="og:title" content="FINE-TUNING YOUR PROGRESS"><meta property="og:description" content="PLANNED SETBACKS
