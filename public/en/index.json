At fifteen, a simple glance back can become a lifelong precious memory. At forty, even someone who manages both work and housework is just another part of life\u0026rsquo;s struggles. As children, playing in the dirt could create lifelong friendships, but as adults, today\u0026rsquo;s sworn brothers might stab you in the back tomorrow.\nA person\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the world develops over time. Things that exist before maturity become fundamental truths, things that appear during maturity become one\u0026rsquo;s own, and things that come after maturity seem strange and alien. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s nostalgia is about their childhood and youth. You hear fifty-year-olds missing their fifteen-year-old sports field, but never hear hundred-year-olds missing their sixty-year-old nursing home. Though the time gap seems the same, the perception of the world is very different.\nIf you appear in someone\u0026rsquo;s life when they\u0026rsquo;re building their understanding of the world, you become part of their world, an important piece of their memories, a significant part of their life. Whenever they remember that time, they can\u0026rsquo;t avoid or forget you. The more involved you were, the bigger your place in their memories, and the more likely you are to touch their heart.\nAlso, people\u0026rsquo;s perception of time speeds up as they age. Three years in middle school feel long and meaningful, from cafeteria to playground, from classroom to campus, from bulletin boards to workbooks\u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s so much to remember. But three years at work pass in a blur - before you even know your coworkers, you\u0026rsquo;re already planning to change jobs or file labor complaints. Who has time to notice who might touch their heart?\nA one-year-old baby is very different from a ten-year-old child, but a seventy-year-old and an eighty-year-old are just elderly people with no distinction. When people get older and lose their own uniqueness, how can they notice others\u0026rsquo; special qualities?\nThe reason it\u0026rsquo;s harder to fall in love with age is that our understanding of the world becomes more complete and clear. We no longer need to fill in gaps. Except for League of Legends designers, no one likes to mess with a mature system. Once something is set, it\u0026rsquo;s set - those who come late are simply late. People start like blank paper - a light stroke can leave a clear mark. But when their picture is already complete, you need much stronger strokes to leave your mark. Everyone has their own story and their own characters in that story, and you might not be in it.\nZhao Yun of Changshan fought bravely and loyally throughout his life, but his dedication still couldn\u0026rsquo;t compare to the brotherhood formed in the Peach Garden.\nCao Cao of Xuzhou gave his heart and trust to Guan Yu, but in the end, Guan Yu still left his position to find his sworn brother through many battles.\nDid they do anything wrong? No, they just came late.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/2025-05-10-why-do-people-find-it-harder-to-be-emotionally-stirred-as-they-grow-older/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBecause you came late, too late, even past mealtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cost of entering someone\u0026rsquo;s heart doubles with age.

In my opinion, we can learn anything just by reading books. So, we can surely gain a language just by reading.\nNow I find that tools or softwares can raise complexity. Features can also bring troubles.

Some people may think that AI is very destructive to the lives of ordinary people. But in my opinion, the most distinct characteristic that humans possess and surpass other creatures is the ability to use tools. AI is a very useful tool now, and it would be highly beneficial if we can learn to use it effectively.\nIn terms of learning English, I have found a lot of useful tools that are built upon artificial intelligence. One of these tools is DeepL, which I noticed several years ago. The quality of its translation is far better than Google Translate. I can smoothly translate an article into another language without worrying about its readability. Moreover, I can easily find a suitable word on DeepL if I forget its expression in another language.\nIn addition to this, I have also found some AI-powered tools for web designing. I am sure that many problems in building a beautiful and powerful website will be solved in the future. As for me, I just need to focus on creating content.\nRecently, the stunning tool called ChatGPT was released, and I’m using it as a grammar checker after finishing a writing practice in English. It’s so useful that I can learn to write by myself without a tutor. I don’t need to worry about errors in writing anymore, and can write freely and smoothly. As a result, I am willing to post my articles written in English online. Though there is still a lot of room for improvement, I can already express some complicated ideas without misunderstanding now.\nAnyway, maybe the reason these tools motivated me is that they give me some confidence in sharing and learning. However, ultimate success in learning depends on our own efforts instead of just relying on tools.

Like languages in linguistic, there are also 5 languages in love. If we cannot understand the love in other’s love language, we cannot communicate love.\nKeeping the love tank full We all have a love tank from our childhood.\nFalling in love It’s a illusion. The average in-love experience lasts two years.\nThe in-love experience is not our own growth. It’s a sense that we arrived.\nPresently 40 percent of first marriages in this country end in divorce. Sixty percent of second marriages and 75 percent of third marriages end the same way. Former generation often choose a life of misery with our spouse. Love Language #1 WORDS OF AFFIRMATION The object of love is not getting something you want but doing something for the well-being of the one you love. Giving encouraging words to your partner, and encouraging him to find his interests. Forgiveness is the language of love. If we cannot forgive, intimacy cannot be built. Requests and demands are different, we can change our words. Threat hurts intimacy. Verbal appreciation is very important. Words are important!\nLove Language #2 Quality Time A central aspect of quality time is togetherness. But we need focused attention.\nWe can do something together. Quality conversation is also a quality time.\nMarriage is a relationship. When your partner say some problems, sometimes she need you to hear, instead of solving problems.\nWhen you are listening, don’t do other something else.\nSometimes Dead Sea (always listen) marries a Babbling Brook (always talk).\nQuality activity: he may never become a symphony lover, but he can become proficient at loving her.\nThink of an activity your spouse enjoys, but which brings little pleasure to you.\nLove Language #3: Receiving Gifts A gift is something you can hold in your hand and say, “Look, he was thinking of me,” or, “She remembered me.”\nIf he received your gifts, he can be your friend.\nIf you are a saver, perhaps you will understand that purchsing gifts for him is the best investment you can make.\nPhysical presence is also important. Your body is the symbol of your love.\nThe value is not the gift itself. It’s depend on the receiver.\nGifts are visual symbols of love. It can be purchased, found, or made.\nLove Language #4: Acts of Service Requests give direction to love, but demands stop the flow of love. Mary and Mark both need the showing of love– doing something for each other.\nBefore marriage, we maybe in the in-love obsession. After marriage, There’s something we could not do. But you need to change for your partner.\nIf you demand something, you will break the flow of love.\nCriticism sometimes indicates a plead for love.\nAllowing oneself to be used or manipulated by another is not an act of love.\nLove Language #5: Physical Touch Ask your spouse where is comfortable, and what touches are irritating.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/2020-11-27-introduction-4/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-happens-to-love-after-the-wedding\"\u003eWhat happens to love after the wedding?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike languages in linguistic, there are also 5 languages in love.

犍陀羅藝術\n前期：貴霜王朝統治時期，約從公元1世紀初至3世紀中葉，以片巖石雕為主。\n後期：薩珊王朝和寄多羅貴霜人統治時期，約從公元3世紀中葉-5世紀末，以泥塑為主。比前期更具古典主義氣質。\n貴霜時代犍陀羅佛像開始打破印度早期佛教藝術的禁忌，遵循希臘、羅馬雕刻的慣例，仿照希臘、羅馬神像的樣品。\n犍陀羅佛陀立像，2-3世紀，片巖，白沙瓦博物館。\n犍陀羅佛陀坐像，2-3世紀，片巖，高73厘米，白沙瓦博物館。\n笈多藝術\n樣式：馬圖拉和薩爾納特，代表印度古典主義最高成就。\n馬圖拉樣式：眉毛細長；眼簾低垂；鼻梁筆直，下唇寬厚，耳垂拉長呈矩形，頸部有三道折痕，被稱為“濕衣佛像”。\n薩爾納特樣式：比馬圖拉樣式更為單薄，幾乎像玻璃一樣完全透明，僅在領口、袖口和下擺邊緣依稀可見幾絲透明衣紋，被稱為“裸體佛像”。\n阿旃陀石窟：開鑿於公元前2世紀-7世紀。雕塑多屬裸體佛像，壁畫運用凹凸暈染法。\n南印度阿馬拉瓦蒂：近似馬圖拉樣式。\n東漸的中介\n康僧會：三國吳時期祖籍康居的僧人康僧會從交趾來到吳都建業（南京）“設像行道”。\n法顯：東晉僧人法顯從長安出發西行求法，經鄯善、於闐而度蔥嶺，歷遊天竺諸國。\n宋雲與比丘惠生：北魏孝明帝或胡太後詔遣使者宋雲與比丘惠生從洛陽出發使西域取經，經於闐至烏萇、犍陀羅諸國。\n玄奘：玄奘從長安西行求法，經高昌、屈支（龜茲）至梵衍那（巴米揚）、犍陀羅等地。並在那爛陀寺留學5年。\n東漸中國西域\n南北兩道：南道於闐等地系由犍陀羅中心地區通過克什米爾即迦濕彌羅（罽賓）傳入；北道龜茲等地系由巴米揚一線向東，或由罽賓北上經犍陀羅中心地區至迦畢試，再由迦畢試向東傳入。南道明顯受到犍陀羅藝術的影響。北道早期較多受到犍陀羅藝術和笈多藝術的影響，中期較多受到印度和波斯藝術的影響，晚期較多受到中國內地藝術的影響。\n鄯善：（樓蘭）佛像體現犍陀羅地區希臘化風格佛像的特征。\n於闐：呈現印度、波斯與中國因素混合的風格。《合十禮拜的菩薩》：人物造型、服飾和色彩的印度風味異常濃厚。 《龍女》： 佩戴的珠寶飾物尤其是三重串鈴的腰帶都屬於古代印度流行的樣式。勾勒身輪廓和細部的線條，類似中國的鐵線描。\n疏勒：在今喀什、巴楚一帶，是西域絲路北道的前站。圖木休克佛陀坐像木雕：具有笈多薩爾納特樣式佛像特征。\n龜茲：佛教遺跡以石窟為主，其中克孜爾石窟規模最大。\n高昌：內地影響更為強烈。\n東漸中國內地\n炳靈寺石窟：甘肅永靖炳靈寺石窟西秦時期的第169窟，屬於“涼州模式”的典型之一。\n曇曜五窟：攝取了犍陀羅佛像的造像傳統或笈多馬圖拉樣式佛像的衣紋表現手法。以三世佛為主，主佛異常高大。雲岡石窟的“平城模式”一再變化，出現了褒衣博帶式服裝和秀骨清像的造型。\n“曹衣出水”：是對當時中國西域與內地流行的吸收了印度笈多馬圖拉樣式佛像影響的一種佛像繪畫與雕塑的形容和總結。\n張僧繇：類似於阿旃陀壁畫中頻繁使用的凹凸暈染法 。尉遲乙僧和吳道子亦熟悉此法。如屍毗王本生圖。\n第二節 東羅馬與薩珊波斯工藝品的輸入 公元363年中國和東羅馬帝國第一次使節往還。 中國境內的東羅馬遺物：金幣和金幣仿制品、金銀器和玻璃器。\n玻璃器：這些玻璃器皿都是由北方運來的羅馬制品。鴨嘴形玻璃水註。\n薩珊波斯工藝品的輸入\n薩珊波斯工藝品對中國南北朝至隋唐時期的藝術和工藝產生重大影響。薩珊波斯藝術的生命超過了王朝存在的年代。\n薩珊銀幣：一種國際貨幣在當時流通於東歐、中亞，6世紀時甚至通用於中國河西地區。\n出土地區大多位於中西交通要沖及其延長線上。 是中國和伊朗文化交流的物證。\n薩珊波斯金銀器：有海獸紋、蓮花紋、馴鹿紋等。錘揲技法被移用於瓷器。\n織錦：5世紀前後出現，多以聯珠圓圈分隔為各種花紋單元。\n吐魯番是出土薩珊波斯風格織錦比較集中的地區。\n織錦對隋唐絲織業產生了重大影響。\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/2020-04-05-2-six-dynasties/","summary":"\u003ch4

They have layers.\nTHANK YOU, ERRORS So this is why you need to make errors, You need some errors to make deviation but along the way you find some discoveries, this is Antifragile.\nLearning from the Mistakes of Others This chapter is about layering, units, hierarchies, the writer told a story about himself: he made an error of lifting stones, and when he is well-calibrated, he translates into small injuries that guide him the next time.\nI think every day itself is also nonsystemic, I made some errors every day, and see what’s on my pain. I can improve tomorrow, that is, a procrastination log is very important.\nHow to Become Mother Teresa This chapter is about relationship or character, you also can get a lot of information from others’ faults. If they don’t make faults, you don’t even know their true character.\nIt can also be used on ourselves. You need to cause mistakes and know it from variability, You should now them and think about why you make these mistakes, then you will get some information, and get rid of the mind of a victim.\nWHY THE AGGREGATE HATE THE INDIVIDUAL The higher-level needs the fragility of the lower one. If some parts died but the group improved.\nWHAT DOES NOT KILL ME KILLS OTHERS Because you already stronger than others, instead of you are stronger, others are killed, the group improved.\nMe and Us\nAs an individual, we need to combat against the antifragility of the mother nature, because mother nature wants us, as an individual to sacrifice.

What I need definitely is someone who is careful and fond of making plans for success.” Analysis\nThe meaning of 用 should be 重用 or 任用 in this chapter, the translation of 用 is “employed,” it’s unclear whether “put on an important position” is an appropriate translation, Legge translated 用 into “called to office,” maybe it’s appropriate to describe 用 in Chinese traditional culture. 行 is a verb in this chapter, refers to 从事 or 实行. 用 and 舍 are opposites, thus the translation of 舍之 is “if not.” The meaning of 藏 is “hide” or “store” as a verb. In this chapter, the translation of 藏 is a proverb from the Bible, “hide a light under a bushel”. But the problem is, this proverb contains negative meaning. Legge’s translation of 藏 is “lie retired,” it’s more descriptive in reality. The meaning of 有 is 拥有 or 占有, therefore,e the translation is “have” or “get.” Legge’s translation is “attained to,” it also makes sense but has been old-fashioned than “have the ability” from the 1970s.\nThe meaning of 行 in this chapter should be 统率, it’s used as a verb, so the translation is “lead.” But Legge’s translation is “conduct,” it’s a noun. If the translation of 行 is conduct, the meaning of this sentence may be changed. 三 should be a fuzzy quantifier, so the translation of 行三军 is “lead troops.” But it’s wrong in this chapter, only a great state has the permission to own 三军. So Legge’s translation is “armies of a great State.”\nThe meaning of 与 is “with” or “praise”, they all make sense. In this context, the translation of 不与 is “don’t work with.” Predicate verb is omitted in the sentence of 则谁与. It is difficult to add a verb, in this degree the translation of 与 is “work.” Legge translated 与 into “act with.” According to his translation of “conduct” in this chapter, if the Master didn’t need to lead troops, Legge’s translation also makes sense.\nThe original meaning of 暴 is “expose” or “fierce.” 暴虎冯河 is a proverb from Shijing. In this sentence, 暴 refers to “fight with a tiger unarmed.”\nIn the sentence of “必也……,” there is no subject and predicate, thus “what I need” is added in the translation. Legge’s translation is “my associate,” It’s a different way to translate this sentence.\nThe original meaning of 惧 is 恐, “fear.” But in this chapter, it doesn’t make sense if translating it into “fear”, according to the next context 好谋而成, the person who is 好谋而成 is full of positive traits, and he is fond of making plans. Therefore, 惧 should be translated into a positive word instead of “fear.” It’s unclear whether “fearful of failure” is an appropriate translation or not. Therefore, the translation of 惧 is “careful”. Legge translated it into a “full of solicitude.” “Solicitude” is more advanced than “careful,” since it has been rarely used since the 1820s. There is trouble when translating 好谋而成, because 好谋 and 成 are both difficult words for translation. In addition, it is difficult to translate 好, 谋 and 成 respectively, and combining them in one sentence. Maybe due to this reason, Legge divided this sentence into two parts and translated them respectively. Legge translated 好谋 into “fond of adjusting his plans,” As for 而成, the original meaning of 成 is “succeed,” Therefore, the translation of this sentence is “success.” Legge translated it into “carry them into execution.”\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/2019-12-09-written-assignment-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranslation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Master said to Yan Yuan, “If I’m employed, I’ll show my talent; If not, I’ll hide my light under a bushel, only you and I have the ability to do it!”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eZi Lu said, “If you lead troops, whom do you want to work with you?” \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Master Said, “If someone attacks a tiger unarmed or crosses a river without a boat, and he died without any regret, I would not work with him.

But “pay court to” has been old-fashioned than “appeal to” from 1800.\n“灶” has two meanings in Chinese: “kitchen stove” or “kitchen god” , In Chinese culture, “灶”is Legge’s translation is “furnace” . Eno’s translation is “kitchen god” , Lau’s translation is “kitchen stove” . In this chapter, “灶”refers to kitchen god living near the kitchen stove, also called “灶神”or “灶君”. Why Legge translated “灶”to “furnace” instead of “stove” or “kitchen stove” ? Maybe it’s due to the limited information on “灶”in Morrison’s dictionary, “灶”、“炉”(fireplace) 、“窖”(cellar) , they all mean a same thing: A furnace. But “灶神”is included in this entry, it refers to “the god of the furnace, employed in the dressing of provisions.” 2For that reason, Legge should know the meaning of “灶”（灶神） in this chapter, therefore we can conclude that Legge’s translation is reasonable.\n“获”means “get” or “capture” , “罪”means “crime” or “fault”. Literally, “获罪”can means “be proved guilty” or “be convicted”. But in this chapter, “罪”doesn’t mean an illegal action which can be punished by law in society, it’s related to “Heaven” , so Legge, Eno and Lau all translated it into “offend against”.\n“天”: Legge’s translation is “Heaven” , Legge explained it as “The lofty one who is on high” . “天”may not be a place in this chapter. It doesn’t mean “Heaven” itself, it may refers to Moral Power or Moral Law3. “Choo He says, Heaven means principle” . Because the concept of “天”is rather ambiguous, Eno just translated “天”into pinyin “tian“.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/2019-10-21-pa-yih-13-analysis/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranlation’s words\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e谓：Legge’s translation: “meaning”, Eno’s translation: “sense”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e媚：Legge: pay court to; Eno: appeal to; Lau: be obsequious to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e灶：Legge: furnance; Eno: the kitchen god; Lau: the kitchen stove\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Pa Yih 13 analysis"},{"content":"Evil making us misunderstanding others, always focus on build some image of others but don’t really true.

Wang-sun Chia asked, saying, “What is the meaning of the saying, ‘It is better to pay court to the furnace than to the south-west corner?\u0026rsquo;”\nThe Master said, “Not so. He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.” Commentary: THAT THERE IS NO RESOURCE AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF VILATING THE RIGHT. Kea is the great officer of Wei, and having the power of the state in his hands, insinuated Confucius that it would be for his advantage to pay court to him. The southwest corner was from the structure of ancient houses the cosiest nook, and the place of honour.\nChoo He explains the proverb by reference to the customs of sacrifice.\nThe furnace was comparatively a mean place, but when the spirit of the furnace was sacrificed to, then the rank of the two places was changed for the time, and the proverb quoted was in vogue. But there does not seem much force in this explanation. The door, or well, or any other of the five things in the regular sacrifices, might take the place of the furnace.\n2 Confucius’ reply was in a high tone. Choo He says, “Heaven means principle” But why should Heaven mean principle, if there were not in such a use of the term an instinctive recognition of a supreme government of intelligence and righteousness We find the term explained by “The lofty one who is on high”.\nEno’s translation:\n3.13 Wangsun Jia asked, “What is the sense of that saying: ‘Better to appeal to the kitchen god than the god of the dark corner?’” The Master said, “Not so! If one offends against Tian, one will have no place at which to pray.”\nCommentary: 3.13 After failing to succeed in reforming the politics of his home state of Lu, Confucius journeyed from state to state in search of a worthy ruler. Here he is in the state of Wei, and the powerful minister of war is suggesting, by means of analogy with customary ideas of household gods, that he, rather than the duke of Wei, is the key to political access in Wei. (See 6.28.)\nD.C. Lau’s translation:\nWang-sun Chia said, “Better to be obsequious to the kitchen stove Than to the south-west corner of the house.* What does that mean?”\nThe Master said, “The saying has got it wrong. When you have offended against Heaven, there is nowhere you can turn to in your prayers.”\n*By ‘the south-west corner of the house’ which is the place of honour Wang-sun Chia, being a minister of Wei, presumably meant to refer to the lord of Wei and by ‘the kitchen stove’ to himself.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/2019-10-12-pa-yih-13-translations/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e【十三章】【一節】王孫賈問曰、與其媚於奧、寧媚於竈、何謂也。【二節】子曰、不然、獲罪於天、無所禱也。\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLegge’s translation:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter XIII. 1.

I just wanted to let you know how important is for me to read all your beautiful comments. To read that someone can feel more relax or empowered and even that this music can help you a little bit to endure your struggle with depression, is something that’s beyond what a composer could ask for and makes me feel a sense of purpose and a strength to move on with my life too. Sadly, sometimes we (myself) are knock out by many cirumcustancies…, and although we all know that eventually things will pass, it’s really hard to move on. At such dark times it is good to cling to what life gives to us…, it may be an idea, a dream, a song…, or even a series of warm comments in a video on you tube (that’s the case). Anything goes to keep going on, to return back to our light.\nI just wanted to show you my gratitude and also encourage you all. Feel free to listen to my track Suns and Stars (Really Slow Motion). It’s there on you tube. Not propaganda. I think that track really can help you also to feel empowered, uplifted and happy…, even if just makes you smile or dream for a second, it will be worthwhile 🙂\nThanks also to HDSounDI for sharing my work.
