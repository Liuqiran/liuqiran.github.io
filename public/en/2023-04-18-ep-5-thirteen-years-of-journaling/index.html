I started journaling in April 2010.
It’s one of the most important habits in my life.
Before 2016, I wrote journals on paper. After 2016, I started to write on app. It’s very convenient to write digitally. After December 2017, I started writing in English.
I became aware that journals are the history of my own life.
Now I have the intention to collect all my journals and publish them in a book. I think it would be very interesting to browse through my whole life.
Looking back to my childhood, I realized that I already have the talent to collect the materials in different periods and save them in order. I enjoyed that kind of feeling."><meta name=author content="Qiran"><link rel=canonical href=https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2023-04-18-ep-5-thirteen-years-of-journaling/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=../../assets/css/stylesheet.d72444526d7ecbdb0015438a7fa89054a658bf759d0542e2e5df81ce94b493ee.css integrity="sha256-1yREUm1+y9sAFUOKf6iQVKZYv3WdBULi5d+BzpS0k+4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://liuqiran.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://liuqiran.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2023-04-18-ep-5-thirteen-years-of-journaling/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2023-04-18-ep-5-thirteen-years-of-journaling/"><meta property="og:title" content="EP 5 Thirteen years of journaling"><meta property="og:description" content="I’ve been journaling for thirteen years.
