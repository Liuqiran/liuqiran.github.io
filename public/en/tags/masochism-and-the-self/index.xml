      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Freud’s theory, masochism is from sadism, another theory said that sadism and masochism are two faces of one coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the recent study shows that maybe masochism is more fundamental. The number of Masochists are much more than sadists’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submissive partners are really in control during SM, because it is the submissive’s desire shapes the sex play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masochistic desires are much stronger than sadistic. But many submissive people cannot find a partner to dominate them because of the shortage. So What happens often is two masochists meet each other, one of them should take turns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
