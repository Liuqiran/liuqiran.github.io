&lt;p>But the recent study shows that maybe masochism is more fundamental. The number of Masochists are much more than sadists’.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The submissive partners are really in control during SM, because it is the submissive’s desire shapes the sex play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Masochistic desires are much stronger than sadistic. But many submissive people cannot find a partner to dominate them because of the shortage. So What happens often is two masochists meet each other, one of them should take turns.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
