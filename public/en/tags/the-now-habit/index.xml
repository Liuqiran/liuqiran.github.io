&lt;p>Due to procrastination, employees lose their productivities and cause companies billions of dollars lost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="commitment-vs-compliance">COMMITMENT VS. COMPLIANCE&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As a manager, you need to use inviting commitment rather than demands for compliance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="focusing-on-starting-vs-finishing">FOCUSING ON STARTING VS. FINISHING&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Effective managers always have the ability to communicate with their employees. Focusing on starting is much more effective for a perfectionist.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="getting-results-or-giving-criticism">GETTING RESULTS OR GIVING CRITICISM&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>You need to give praise instead of criticism for employees. Praise even needs to precede the recommendations for improvement.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>State Your Priorities Clearly&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Don’t change your priority too often.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Be Decisive&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
You need to be decisive and don’t change the goal during the project. When you choose one, don’t change it.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Be Fair and Frequent in Your Rewards&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Craving to be appreciated is a deep need in human nature.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>LIVING WITH A PROCRASTINATOR&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Maybe you are living with a procrastinator, you didn’t need to put commands do them, just say I would instead of you should.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>A LAST WORD&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Go ahead! Don’t say I’ll try or it’s not working, just be open-minded and do it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FINE-TUNING YOUR PROGRESS</title><link>https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2020-02-08-fine-tuning-your-progress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 10:31:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2020-02-08-fine-tuning-your-progress/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>PLANNED SETBACKS&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
You can try to plan procrastination when you meet a big project, and record your self-statement, these statements may be your old pattern.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="resilience-and-hardiness">RESILIENCE AND HARDINESS&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Resilience&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Resilience is very important when you fail, every time you fail you can bounce back from it and know your performance isn’t your self-worth, but your performance is connected to your perseverance. You don’t need to be responsible for what had happened to you, but you need to be responsible for how to tackle these problems. Sarah’s experience told us that you will meet some obstacles placed by others, but you don’t need to put these pressure on yourself, you just need to set a time for yourself and see how much you can finish.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WORKING IN THE FLOW STATE</title><link>https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2020-01-18-working-in-the-flow-state/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2020 15:00:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2020-01-18-working-in-the-flow-state/</guid><description>&lt;p>Being into the state of flow is beneficial to your mental and physical health.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>USING MORE OF YOUR BRAIN&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Using your left side of your brain is important, you need to shift into a state of flow. You need to stop your linear thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>IT’S ONLY YOUR FIRST DRAFT&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Creativity is important, how to get into it? You need to suspend criticism and linear thought and get into the state of flow.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>6. THE UNSCHEDULE</title><link>https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2019-11-24-6-the-unschedule/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2019 13:06:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2019-11-24-6-the-unschedule/</guid><description>&lt;p>When things start, we find the projects take less time than your thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="even-producers-need-a-system">EVEN PRODUCERS NEED A SYSTEM&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This system is recording your time in the period of working, record every time in your period, you will reduce your fear about your so-called threatening subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="reverse-psychology">&lt;strong>REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If you restrict your time of the study, you may have an aversion about it, you want to break the authority for yourself, and you will find you will increase your time of the study. So, set a rule of your working time, like “don’t work more than four hours a day”, you’ll find you want to work more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OVERCOMING BLOCKS TO ACTION</title><link>https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2019-10-19-overcoming-blocks-to-action/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2019 10:55:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://liuqiran.github.io/en/2019-10-19-overcoming-blocks-to-action/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>THREE MAJOR BLOCKS&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

Goal: supportive of yourself
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The questions about yourself:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Obligation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time (vague terms such as “sometime next week” )&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goals and value. (distracted by another plan)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mood, fear.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Conclusion: Our real distress comes from constant anxiety of delaying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is important to notice the healing system. But Why we procrastinate? Because we fear a threat to our independence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fear of judgment is the key fear that stems from over-identifying who you are.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
