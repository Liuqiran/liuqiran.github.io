      <title>Writing freely</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/writing-freely/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now I find my writing skill is gradually improving. My writing speed is faster than before. The problem is that I face some stress when I need to post publicly. I’m still afraid of showing the errors and flaws of my article.&lt;br&gt;
But I know no one can be perfect. Modifying the article and checking the grammar incessantly will kill the interest and motivation of writing.&lt;br&gt;
In addition, It’s my own website. I think if other people don’t like, they can unfollow me.&lt;br&gt;
In any case, I will try our best to practice more and share my thoughts which I think valuable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the real harmful radiation is from the devices in our daily life. When we are using our smartphone or other electronic tools, it’s possible to be exposed to radiation. Some people think the radition from phone is not enough to cause negative effect to our body. I take a sceptical attitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>EP 14 Information quality</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ep-14-information-quality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my own opinion, there are three kinds of information in our life.&lt;br&gt;
The first one is text, the second is audio, the last one is video.&lt;br&gt;
Let’s talk about the first one. The content of texts is based on words. It’s the most abstract form of information. If we are literate, we can understand words, then we can understand road signs, posters, magazines, and books. It’s simplest to save texts for us. It’s also a form that can save the best information quality. But it’s maybe the hardest information to understand. Books contain the deepest information quality.&lt;br&gt;
Audio is another kind of information, it’s based on sounds. It’s more natural to us because we can use our ear to understand. But we can’t control the speed of understanding. We probably also receive some useless information.&lt;br&gt;
The third one is video. It combines sound and image. We can understand it very well, but it’s more shallow. Normally, information quality of video is not that good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ep-13-anki-and-offline/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been using Anki as my reviewing tool from 2017.&lt;br&gt;
Anki is a very powerful and effective tool, it’s also one of the best tools for learning a language. There is also no alternative of Anki as a tool for creating your own database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I gradually felt its disadvantages. It’s a software. I always need to use it on computer or on smartphone. To form a habit, I need to open it everyday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Repetition is an essential part in our life.&lt;br&gt;
Life is started from one cell. But just by copying itself, one cell can grow into a complicate system with different features. It’s a form of repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we need to memorize something, we aIso need a lot of repetitions. Maybe it’s very boring, but I can’t deny it’s a very effective way.&lt;br&gt;
When we need to gain a skill, we also need a lot of repetitions. We usually started from a very basic practice. Only after enough times of practice, we can learn more advanced skill.&lt;br&gt;
At first, even a basic skill is challenging to us, After enough repetition, it will become more and more easier. Then based on this skill there can growing more advanced skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a wallet and started using cash again recently.&lt;br&gt;
It’s a very interesting try. I’ve been getting used to pay by smartphone for many years. It’s feeling weird after suddenly giving up E-pay. But now I found that I can still be relaxed when I going out without smartphone.&lt;br&gt;
When I was paying, the feeling of “touching money” is very authentic. Compare with just tapping on the phone, I prefer the feeling of real money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is a essential part in the life of thinking and learning. It’s also indispensible for me.&lt;br&gt;
But the way of writing has changed a lot. Writing on paper is the most traditional way.&lt;br&gt;
I can still vaguely remember the days when I was writing journal on paper under the dim light of lamp. I enjoyed the feeling of writing on paper.&lt;br&gt;
But it’s very inconvenient to write on paper. We can’t take all of our notebooks easily. It’s also difficult to look up former words.&lt;br&gt;
I started writing on note-taking apps in 2016. It’s really convenient and solved the former problems.&lt;br&gt;
There are a lot of features on noke-taking apps. We can change the style and font of notes. We can insert images, audios, even attachments of any format…&lt;br&gt;
But in recent years I realized I spent so much time on the features of the software. It created a lot of difficulties to saving and sharing. Another problem is that, note-taking app is installed on electronic devices. Phones and computers contains more features and notifcations. Now I think this way of writing also has its negative effect. It will create a lot of distractions.&lt;br&gt;
Recently I started writing in plain text. I can write in any note-taking softwares. Using special device for writing is also a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to be too stubborn and stick to the Linux. Tools are used for improving efficiency instead of for playing. Some ideas are not so that important.&lt;br&gt;
Windows is very powerful now especially after the coming of Android Subsystem. On Linux, I can’t find a similar software as stable as Subsystem. Waydroid and Genymotion have a lot of problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ep-10-temporary-guest/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was organizing my contact information. I found a lot of people I haven’t contacted in a long time. As time goes by, they disappear from my life and never reappear. It’s as if they died even though I have their information. Each of them is like a temporary guest. I don’t know if there will be a chance for us to meet in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m gradually able to start a new relationship. But at the moment I still don’t have the ability to reconnect with old people, but I’m trying my best. I feel that many people don’t have this ability because of embarrassment. We just let these relationships die one by one. I don’t want to be isolated, so to avoid that situation, I also have to overcome my fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the recommendation from Rich Dad’s book, I try to install the Cashflow game. But the desktop version of E-Game is difficult to install now. I tried my best to install it successfully in VirtualBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I have been playing the Cashflow 101 e-game. I have gradually become proficient at it. It’s very educational and I’ve gained some knowledge about cash. These days I started to try Cashflow 202. It’s more complicated compared to the 101 edition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ep-9-technical-breakdown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I went through a serious problem of my server, on which my website runs.&lt;br&gt;
It started with the problem of the version of PHP. The edition of the current PHP is very old and it couldn’t support the running of some plugins. Then I tried to install a new version of PHP, but it didn’t work. When I tried to uninstall the old version, the server crashed and could not be restarted due to an error called “kernel panic”.&lt;br&gt;
I’ve done my best to fix it myself until midnight. It’s useless. I could only ask other people for help. The technical staff couldn’t solve it either, but they helped me to backup the data. It’s a very tedious experience and I could restore my server after several days. Finally, I used the backup data and restored my website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Just keep going.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>EP 8 Real wealth</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/ep-8-real-wealth/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 15:07:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ep-8-real-wealth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wealth is usually considered to be money. But in my opinion, true wealth does not only contain money. It can contain many things, such as health, wisdom, and experience.&lt;br&gt;
An essential part of wealth is health. We inherited our health from our ancestors when we were born. It’s innate and priceless. But we can partially change it. We can destroy health, but we can also increase it.&lt;br&gt;
Another part of wealth is wisdom. Although our health can be inherited, we can’t inherit wisdom. Through learning, reading, and education, we can gradually get wisdom. Everyone has their own wisdom. It’s also priceless in different people’s lives.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, experience is also a part of wealth. Good experience is wealth, and bad experience is a kind of debt. But whether it is good or bad, whether it is a wealth or a liability, all depends on how you look at yourself. Everybody has unique experiences. If we can get more experience, we might be able to handle challenges more easily in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/complicate-physical-activities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, simple physical activities are not enough to improve mental health.&lt;br&gt;
As human beings, we get used to coordinate with our mind and body. Repeated and easy activities are boring. If the activities are more complicated, it’s better for our mentality. We can also combine different activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ep-7-practice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Practice is one of the most important things in our life.&lt;br&gt;
In order to gain our skill or improve our ability, we all need to have enough practice.&lt;br&gt;
Practice is repeated action. Enough times of repetition is necessary in our life. If we do a lot of practice, we will definitely get some improvements unconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the beginning of the practice is very difficult. We think it’s hard, it’s a big challenge. We may have tried many times, but there are still no results at all. We want to give up. But if we continue and persevere, as the times of practice increase, our improvement will be faster and faster. This is a phenomenon that shows up in many areas. The problem is that we give up so easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ep-6-plain-text/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used a lot of software to store my notes and data. But gradually I found that although these softwares are very convenient and they offer a lot of good services. They also caused me a lot of trouble in the long run.&lt;br&gt;
One important reason is that you cannot export your data freely. I tried a lot of softwares after I decided to write online. Many of them don’t provide good export service. Your files can only be exported to some special formats. What’s more, these files can only be viewed in some special forms. We can probably convert them to other formats we want, but it’s not that easy.&lt;br&gt;
Another reason is that I realized that some tools and services could give you a lot of convenience and unique features, but when you get used to it. You are also limited by these tools. Your choice would be less, and it’s also very inconvenient if you want to change your tool. Especially for a person who is always curious about new tools. Technology is a double-edged sword. I always want to find a suitable tool for writing, learning, productivity, etc. But the result is not so good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating an effective and automated system is very important.&lt;br&gt;
I always look at the tools. But any tools should be built on a good system. Tools are medium. I must know how to use these tools.&lt;br&gt;
With an effective and stable system, you don’t even need a tool with high technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 09:52:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ep-5-thirteen-years-of-journaling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been journaling for thirteen years.&lt;br&gt;
I started journaling in April 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the most important habits in my life.&lt;br&gt;
Before 2016, I wrote journals on paper. After 2016, I started to write on app. It’s very convenient to write digitally. After December 2017, I started writing in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware that journals are the history of my own life.&lt;br&gt;
Now I have the intention to collect all my journals and publish them in a book. I think it would be very interesting to browse through my whole life.&lt;br&gt;
Looking back to my childhood, I realized that I already have the talent to collect the materials in different periods and save them in order. I enjoyed that kind of feeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reading the first five books of the Bible</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 09:55:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/reading-the-first-five-books-of-the-bible/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After almost a year of intermittent reading, I have finally finished the first five books of the Old Testament. The first five books are also called the books of Moses.&lt;br&gt;
I suddenly realized that probably seventy percent of the Bible is the Old Testament. Only a small part of it is the New Testament. The Old Testament is written in Hebrew, and the New Testament is written in Greek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some stories that impressed me a lot. Killing and punishment may be the theme during the time of Moses. There is a city called Sodom, which is a city that indulges in lust and sin. People run away before Yahweh destroys this city completely. But the people who turned their heads and looked back at Sodom, still became pillars of salt.&lt;br&gt;
Moses and the generation of Israel living in Egypt ran away from it, all could not see the land promised by God. Only they all died, later generations can start the journey and see the land.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m Qiran. Today, I would like to share with you my understanding of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gradually realized that AI has already entered my life. Some people may think that AI is very destructive to the lives of ordinary people. But in my opinion, the most distinct characteristic that humans possess and surpass other creatures is the ability to use tools. AI is a very useful tool now, and it would be highly beneficial if we can learn to use it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/stickers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do I no longer use stickers? For me, the use of stickers distorts the understanding of others. I don’t think it’s an effective or appropriate way to communicate with others online. The Internet is already full of entertaining and useless information. Using stickers will make this situation worse. Using words is enough to convey accurate information. Although without stickers, some people will think that it will feel that there is no emotion. But the truth is that the Internet cannot emulate the real conversation. Calling and talking face to face may be a better way for communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ep-3-feel-the-fear/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Qiran. Today I would like to share with you my understanding of fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is one of the basic human emotions. We all have fears. As for me, fear is one of my biggest difficulties in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of fear.&lt;br&gt;
The first fear of myself is the fear of being disappointed by others. In terms of human relationships, I’m really an infant now. I am afraid of falling.&lt;br&gt;
I always avoid dealing with others, just like an infant avoids learning to walk. But if I never fall down, I cannot learn to walk forever.&lt;br&gt;
I knew I had to accept disappointments. Maybe I’m able to collect them in order to develop my abilities. I don’t have to take them personally. Disappointments are actually assets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we were kids, elders always tell us not to lie. But most of us lie because we are afraid of the consequences after telling the truths. As a child, lying is a good protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always a bad habit to lie to yourself or to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lying can distort our understanding of reality. When we lie to ourselves, at first we think we can avoid the difficulties or solve some problems. But we will gradually lose the ability to face the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>EP 2 The tree of habits</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Qiran. Today I would like to share with you some of my understanding about habits.&lt;br&gt;
In my life, the concept of cultivating habits is gradually becoming one of the most important parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, habit is a compound interest. The fruits or effects of habits will grow faster and faster in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, one of the examples of daily habit is writing journals. Maybe it’s my longest habit, which started from my middle school time. Now it has become my important habit that records my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ep-01-why-i-start-my-podcast/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone. I’m Qiran. This is the first episode of my podcast. Today’s topic is that, I want to share reasons about why I start my podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reason is, it’s a place of sharing my thoughts and my understanding covering a lot of topics. It’s an opportunity to exchange ideas with others, maybe I can meet new friends and learn a lot from others in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I think I can cover a lot of topics that I’m interested in. Forcing myself to write something is a good habit to learn, and it’ll also help me improve my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I definitely know Austria.&lt;br&gt;
You can find out more about me on my personal website. By the way, why not leave a footprint there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s great that you’re interested in learning a language. It’s a long way for learning something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is. I’m Qiran. Nice to meet you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can still access it on the dark web for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;what-happens-to-love-after-the-wedding&#34;&gt;What happens to love after the wedding?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like languages in linguistic, there are also 5 languages in love. If we cannot understand the love in other’s love language, we cannot communicate love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;keeping-the-love-tank-full&#34;&gt;Keeping the love tank full&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have a love tank from our childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;falling-in-love&#34;&gt;Falling in love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a illusion. The average in-love experience lasts two years.&lt;br&gt;
The in-love experience is not our own growth. It’s a sense that we arrived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-your-habits-shape-your-identity-and-vice-versa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are three layers: outcomes; process; identity.&lt;br&gt;
Identity is the deepest.&lt;br&gt;
“I’m not a smoker” is better than “I don’t smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of beliefs like absolute authority and strict obedience. You can imagine many ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such behavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship. That’s not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.

You are more vulnerable when you get addicted.&lt;br&gt;
You will become a poor or little snowflake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MEETING MY INNER TROLL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The author said BUMMER causes two extremes, be an asshole or be very careful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THE MYSTERIOUS NATURE OF ASSHOLE AMPLIFICATION TECHNOLOGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
we need to be solitary wolves rather than wolves in packs. When we are in the pack, we cannot think individuality, but in a group cult.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THE MOST MASTERFUL MASTER SWITCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rather than Facebook or Twitter, LinkedIn built a high environment because there is no reason to catch your attention.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;GO TO WHERE YOU ARE KINDEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t let your character degrade. When you latch on a platform, you always get irritable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When people are fake, everything becomes fake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can’t even know who is real people.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BUMMER kills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
BUMMER made people believe fake things. Some people don’t believe vaccines, then once-defeated diseases revived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Awareness, transformation and intent are three masteries that lead people to become Toltecs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Death is a angel&lt;/strong&gt;, teaches us live everyday as if it is the last day of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

I WANT YOU TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU HAVE. Use our imagination, and your emotions to dream heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prayers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We can be a prayer for love, a prayer for freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Use your attention intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRACTICE: DELETE SOCIAL MEDIA FROM YOUR PHONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It actually forces you to approach them with more intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice: Use Social media like a professional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Like Jennifer, we need to use Twitter as a professional.&lt;br&gt;
Do not surfing it endlessly, just check some accounts you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRACTICE: EMBRACE SLOW MEDIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“low information diet”: Eliminating what’s bad aggressively than celebrating what’s good.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;True justice is paying only once for each mistake. True injustice is paying more than once for each mistake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;the-first-agreement&#34;&gt;The first agreement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be impeccable with your word.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Self-rejection is the biggest sin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You can live in heaven in the middle of thousands of people living in hell because you are immune to that hell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;the-second-agreement&#34;&gt;The second agreement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t take anything personally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If you don’t take the emotional poison, it becomes even worse in the sender, but not in you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leisure and the good life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As Aristotle’s lead, joyful activities is a “source of inward joy”. We can call them high-quality leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bennett principle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(FI 2.0 movement is that if you can radically reduce your living expenses, you gain two advantages– you save money at a much faster pace and you don’t have to save as much to become independent.)&lt;br&gt;
When you gain FI at a young age, you gain much leisure hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice: leave your phone at home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Having your phone is not a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice: Take long walks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Walking is better than sedentary. “If you’re wearing headphones, you are not really walking.”&lt;br&gt;
But the hardest part of this practice is making the time.&lt;br&gt;
Broaden your definition of “good weather”! You can get big rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice: Write letter to yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It”s a simple and easy practice to to deploy, but it’s also inscredibly effective.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Smartphones changed our life, but they changed us drastically and no one predicted that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOBACCO FARMERS IN T-SHIRTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Whether You Want It or Not…It’s Yours</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE TRUTH IS THAT YOU REALLY ARE IN CONTROL—IN TOTAL CONTROL. You are consciously or unconsciously choosing to be in that lousy job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;wp-block-list&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Taking responsibility means never blaming anyone else for anything you are being, doing, having, or feeling.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Taking responsibility means not blaming yourself.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Taking responsibility means being aware of where and when you are NOT taking responsibility so that you can eventually change.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Taking responsibility means handling the Chatterbox.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Taking responsibility means being aware of payoffs that keep you “stuck.” (Don&amp;#8217;t think &amp;#8220;if only&amp;#8221;)
  &lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pain to power; Helplessness to choice; Depression to Energy; Paralysis to action;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a power of love yourself, power of good love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;love and power go together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pain+—–+——+power&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m powerful and I am loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action is very powerful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be too serious! (Don’t be as my dad)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope” is a pain. You are not a victim, you just need to say “I know”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are responsible for your faults, then you can avoid it the next time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;说实在话，现在网上的流行歌曲越来越“刺激”，什么生僻字、芒种，还有绿色，只是堆砌辞藻一点内涵都没有，00后和90后的差别应该已经很大了吧。&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;wp-block-embed__wrapper&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再次听到了许嵩的《半城烟沙》，回忆起了初中时光。&lt;br&gt;
许嵩是我初中时期的喜欢的网络歌手。08年前后那个时期流行“网络歌手”这个词，许嵩应该算是网络歌手里面最出色的吧，歌写得好、词也写得很棒。&lt;br&gt;
那时，这算是当时流行的网络歌曲了。&lt;br&gt;
那时，我会打开音乐软件，为下载了他的歌曲而高兴半天。感受年轻学生所谓的与众不同。&lt;br&gt;
这算是最早的“流行”吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不知道什么时候开始，当时跟风听许嵩歌的人说“都已经听不下去了”，“听腻了”。好像再唱许嵩的歌，就是什么落伍的事情。&lt;br&gt;
后来我已经不再关注什么歌曲流行了。&lt;br&gt;
一下子十年就过去了，生活越来越浮躁，我想问，那些说许嵩歌“落伍”的同学们，你们在哪里呢？还会跟着00后哼歌吗？&lt;br&gt;
同学说，许嵩是一个低调的人。&lt;br&gt;
是啊，相比起当时“网络歌手”的他来说，他已经更加低调了，但还是有人默默喜欢他的音乐。&lt;br&gt;
原来，我才是真正的“非主流”。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;我之正使敵視之為奇我之奇使敵視之為正正亦為奇奇亦為正.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;凡戰者, 以正合, 以奇勝。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In order to secure victory, indirect methods are also important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;戰勢不過奇正, 奇正之變, 不勝窮也。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are unending series maneuvers derived from 奇 and 正. In a war, we can use so many ways. Why just always think about 正?&lt;br&gt;
It’s hard for me to use Zheng, but Qi is also useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;勢如擴弯, 節如發機。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this sentence, 勢 equals energy. Release your energy as soon as possible when a war begins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;一、此文中如何理解“气”的美学意义？“气”这个概念为何对于艺术创作来说格外重要？&lt;br&gt;
天地人的世界，不僅遵循著一致性原則，同樣也遵循類比性原則。它是一種主客互攝式的一體式的關係。“傍及萬品，动植皆文……”氣學的解释話語可涵蓋文學活动的各個方面。氣的這種自由出入、實象與虛境化合、包容萬有的質性十分契合藝術活动的本質特征。“神远”與“虛靜”开啓了客體與主體整體融和的一種境界，是中國式的意會體悟的言說方式。氣的一體兩面的特征貫通文學世界與形上世界。&lt;br&gt;
造藝者的知、情、志、意的心理活动的整體性消融與化合，是需要借助于氣之關聯與貫通，纔可達致內外世界的和諧統一。“氣無奇類，文乏異采”、“氣偉而采奇”說明氣乃是構建文字、語言、辞采的前提。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二、此文中讲到的刘勰“江山之助”论的思想内涵有哪些可能？他最后同意哪一种来源？&lt;br&gt;
江山有抒發郁拂寥廓之氣，可直接詮释為貶謫。從根本上看，要在天、人之際達到平衡，不僅需要自然景物的陶冶，還要現實生活的感發，因此江山不等同於“山林皋壤”，而是指社会政治因素，這也是成就屈原《離騒》的更重要的內因。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;第一節-犍陀羅藝術與笈多藝術的東漸&#34;&gt;第一節 犍陀羅藝術與笈多藝術的東漸&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;犍陀羅藝術&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
前期：貴霜王朝統治時期，約從公元1世紀初至3世紀中葉，以片巖石雕為主。&lt;br&gt;
後期：薩珊王朝和寄多羅貴霜人統治時期，約從公元3世紀中葉-5世紀末，以泥塑為主。比前期更具古典主義氣質。&lt;br&gt;
貴霜時代犍陀羅佛像開始打破印度早期佛教藝術的禁忌，遵循希臘、羅馬雕刻的慣例，仿照希臘、羅馬神像的樣品。&lt;br&gt;
犍陀羅佛陀立像，2-3世紀，片巖，白沙瓦博物館。&lt;br&gt;
犍陀羅佛陀坐像，2-3世紀，片巖，高73厘米，白沙瓦博物館。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;笈多藝術&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
樣式：馬圖拉和薩爾納特，代表印度古典主義最高成就。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;馬圖拉樣式&lt;/strong&gt;：眉毛細長；眼簾低垂；鼻梁筆直，下唇寬厚，耳垂拉長呈矩形，頸部有三道折痕，被稱為“濕衣佛像”。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;薩爾納特樣式&lt;/strong&gt;：比馬圖拉樣式更為單薄，幾乎像玻璃一樣完全透明，僅在領口、袖口和下擺邊緣依稀可見幾絲透明衣紋，被稱為“裸體佛像”。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;阿旃陀石窟&lt;/strong&gt;：開鑿於公元前2世紀-7世紀。雕塑多屬裸體佛像，壁畫運用凹凸暈染法。&lt;br&gt;
南印度阿馬拉瓦蒂：近似馬圖拉樣式。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;東漸的中介&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
康僧會：三國吳時期祖籍康居的僧人康僧會從交趾來到吳都建業（南京）“設像行道”。&lt;br&gt;
法顯：東晉僧人法顯從長安出發西行求法，經鄯善、於闐而度蔥嶺，歷遊天竺諸國。&lt;br&gt;
宋雲與比丘惠生：北魏孝明帝或胡太後詔遣使者宋雲與比丘惠生從洛陽出發使西域取經，經於闐至烏萇、犍陀羅諸國。&lt;br&gt;
玄奘：玄奘從長安西行求法，經高昌、屈支（龜茲）至梵衍那（巴米揚）、犍陀羅等地。並在那爛陀寺留學5年。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;東漸中國西域&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
南北兩道：南道於闐等地系由犍陀羅中心地區通過克什米爾即迦濕彌羅（罽賓）傳入；北道龜茲等地系由巴米揚一線向東，或由罽賓北上經犍陀羅中心地區至迦畢試，再由迦畢試向東傳入。南道明顯受到犍陀羅藝術的影響。北道早期較多受到犍陀羅藝術和笈多藝術的影響，中期較多受到印度和波斯藝術的影響，晚期較多受到中國內地藝術的影響。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;鄯善&lt;/strong&gt;：（樓蘭）佛像體現犍陀羅地區希臘化風格佛像的特征。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;於闐&lt;/strong&gt;：呈現印度、波斯與中國因素混合的風格。&lt;strong&gt;《合十禮拜的菩薩》&lt;/strong&gt;：人物造型、服飾和色彩的印度風味異常濃厚。 &lt;strong&gt;《龍女》&lt;/strong&gt;： 佩戴的珠寶飾物尤其是三重串鈴的腰帶都屬於古代印度流行的樣式。勾勒身輪廓和細部的線條，類似中國的鐵線描。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;疏勒&lt;/strong&gt;：在今喀什、巴楚一帶，是西域絲路北道的前站。&lt;strong&gt;圖木休克佛陀坐像木雕&lt;/strong&gt;：具有笈多薩爾納特樣式佛像特征。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;龜茲&lt;/strong&gt;：佛教遺跡以石窟為主，其中克孜爾石窟規模最大。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;高昌&lt;/strong&gt;：內地影響更為強烈。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;東漸中國內地&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;炳靈寺石窟&lt;/strong&gt;：甘肅永靖炳靈寺石窟西秦時期的第169窟，屬於“涼州模式”的典型之一。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;曇曜五窟&lt;/strong&gt;：攝取了犍陀羅佛像的造像傳統或笈多馬圖拉樣式佛像的衣紋表現手法。以三世佛為主，主佛異常高大。雲岡石窟的“平城模式”一再變化，出現了褒衣博帶式服裝和秀骨清像的造型。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“曹衣出水”&lt;/strong&gt;：是對當時中國西域與內地流行的吸收了印度笈多馬圖拉樣式佛像影響的一種佛像繪畫與雕塑的形容和總結。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;張僧繇&lt;/strong&gt;：類似於阿旃陀壁畫中頻繁使用的凹凸暈染法 。尉遲乙僧和吳道子亦熟悉此法。如屍毗王本生圖。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;第二節-東羅馬與薩珊波斯工藝品的輸入&#34;&gt;第二節 東羅馬與薩珊波斯工藝品的輸入&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;公元363年中國和東羅馬帝國第一次使節往還。 中國境內的東羅馬遺物：&lt;strong&gt;金幣&lt;/strong&gt;和金幣仿制品、金銀器和玻璃器。&lt;br&gt;
玻璃器：這些玻璃器皿都是由北方運來的羅馬制品。鴨嘴形玻璃水註。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;薩珊波斯工藝品的輸入&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
薩珊波斯工藝品對中國南北朝至隋唐時期的藝術和工藝產生重大影響。薩珊波斯藝術的生命超過了王朝存在的年代。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;薩珊銀幣&lt;/strong&gt;：一種國際貨幣在當時流通於東歐、中亞，6世紀時甚至通用於中國河西地區。&lt;br&gt;
出土地區大多位於中西交通要沖及其延長線上。 是中國和伊朗文化交流的物證。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;薩珊波斯金銀器&lt;/strong&gt;：有海獸紋、蓮花紋、馴鹿紋等。錘揲技法被移用於瓷器。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;織錦&lt;/strong&gt;：5世紀前後出現，多以聯珠圓圈分隔為各種花紋單元。&lt;br&gt;
吐魯番是出土薩珊波斯風格織錦比較集中的地區。&lt;br&gt;
織錦對隋唐絲織業產生了重大影響。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the variation comes, people will rush into the door.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;HUNGRY DONKEYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Equal distance between food and water makes donkey die of hunger or thirst.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Political Annealing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The problem of the United States is the two-party system, you cannot randomize a party that doesn’t exist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Second Step: Do (Small) Wars Save Lives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maybe the small wars or some battles strengthen the country.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What to Tell the Foreign Policy Makers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Saudi Arabia and the US formed an alliance for stability, but it’s very dangerous in the long run. Royalties controlled the whole country, but this alliance strengthens the fundamentalism underground. Maybe the country will get into a more disastrous situation in the future.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHAT DO WE CALL HERE MODERNITY?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We are moving into a period of modernity of MBA, lobbyist, secularization, etc.&lt;br&gt;
The taxman, fear of the boss, and separate the work and leisure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BUMMER MACHINE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The better analogy for social media is paint contains lead in a house.&lt;br&gt;
BUMMER: “Behaviors of Users Modified, and Made into an Empire for Rent”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THE PARTS THAT MAKE UP THE BUMMER MACHINE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ais for Attention Acquisition leading to Asshole supremacy: this makes people online all nasty.&lt;br&gt;
B Information and data always being recorded.&lt;br&gt;
The BUMMER machine also makes the tech giant stronger, and it also creates a fake world.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THE PROBLEM IS LIMITED, SO WE CAN CONTAIN IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
BUMMER is the problem to avoid, we need to delete BUMMER accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;第一節-外來工藝品與佛教藝術的東傳&#34;&gt;第一節 外來工藝品與佛教藝術的東傳&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;西漢時期對外交流：絲綢之路；可能的海上航道。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;將域外想象為神秘的超自然的世界&lt;/strong&gt;，激發了社會對於域外物質與文化的興趣。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;民間與西域的交往最早開始於&lt;strong&gt;先秦時期&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;br&gt;
代表：&lt;strong&gt;青銅錯金銀有翼神獸&lt;/strong&gt;。（或許與中亞、中亞的格裏芬形象有關）&lt;br&gt;
古代遊牧民族的遷徙對早期歐亞大陸的交流起到重要作用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;來自域外的工藝品&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;器皿&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;銀盒&lt;/strong&gt;：水滴紋凸瓣，公元前2世紀，廣州西漢南越王墓出土。采用錘揲工藝（可能來自古波斯），有的有青銅圈足和飾件。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;銀壺&lt;/strong&gt;：青海大通上孫家寨乙區3號墓出土，漢末至魏晉初年，肩部以錯金工藝裝飾六朵花葉，從風格看有可能是中亞的產品。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;玻璃托盞&lt;/strong&gt;：1-2世紀，廣西貴縣南鬥村出土，淺綠色，還有黃綠色玻璃瓶，均屬羅馬玻璃制品。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;紡織品&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;壁掛殘片&lt;/strong&gt;：公元前2世紀-公元2世紀，新疆洛浦縣山普拉1號墓出土，上端人頭馬，下端執矛武士（可能是亞歷山大）。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;棉布殘片&lt;/strong&gt;：1-2世紀，新疆民豐尼雅出土，白地印藍花，左下角有手持豐饒角的豐產女神德莫忒爾裸體半身像。（可能來自貴霜王朝的犍陀羅地區）&lt;br&gt;
這些考古發現的工藝品，是漢代不同社會階層與域外交流的&lt;strong&gt;見證&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;受外來文化影響的內地工藝品&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;玉角形杯&lt;/strong&gt;：公元前2世紀，西漢南越王墓出土，可能源於西方的酒器“來通” 。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;鍍錫銀盒&lt;/strong&gt;：前述外來的水滴紋凸瓣銀盒相似，被推定為仿制品。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;東漢胡人石雕&lt;/strong&gt;：2世紀，山東青州出土。胡人石雕以四川、山東最為常見。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;佛教藝術的東傳&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;八角石柱&lt;/strong&gt;：山東沂南北寨東漢墓，2世紀。兩尊帶項光的立像，與各種仙人和祥瑞並置。&lt;br&gt;
佛塔上的相輪（窣堵波）和中國傳統樓閣的結合。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;四川樂山麻浩崖墓佛像&lt;/strong&gt;：四川樂山麻浩東漢崖墓中的佛像，頭光、肉髻，著袈裟，結跏趺坐，具有佛像的典型特征。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;搖錢樹上的佛坐像&lt;/strong&gt;：四川彭山東崖墓出土，2世紀，樹座上和樹身上的西王母的形象有時被替換為佛像。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;佛塔畫像磚&lt;/strong&gt;：四川什邡白果村，東漢至蜀漢，樓閣上有剎桿、三重露盤、寶珠，是佛教觀念和神仙系統的樓閣建築對接的結果。&lt;br&gt;
特別的文化現象：佛像作為道教偶像雜於道教藝術中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;第二節-漢代藝術在東方各國的傳播&#34;&gt;第二節 漢代藝術在東方各國的傳播&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;越南東山時代&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
東山時代：公元前至公元二世紀，受中國戰國至漢代影響。&lt;br&gt;
漢文化遺物：石斧、&lt;strong&gt;青銅制作的鼓&lt;/strong&gt;、玉質裝身具、&lt;strong&gt;陶瓷&lt;/strong&gt;、貨幣。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;東山銅鼓&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;br&gt;
銅鼓紋樣：圓弧紋、鋸齒紋、飛鳥紋、船紋、蛙紋。&lt;br&gt;
用途：用於呼喚靈魂的巫術祭儀、用於農耕儀式特別是乞求降雨或者象征著統治者的王權。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;河內出土陶瓷&lt;/strong&gt;：酷似漢代的硬灰陶、也有施透明灰釉的灰釉陶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;朝鮮樂浪時代&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
樂浪時代：公元前108至313年，屬中國統治範圍，中心為樂浪郡。&lt;br&gt;
樂浪漢墓：在今平壤，有木槨、磚室兩種。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;樂浪漆器&lt;/strong&gt;：保存於木槨墓中，器面多用紅、黃、綠三色，繪有人物、動物等。與長沙馬王堆漢墓漆器並稱為東方漆器雙壁。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;畫像磚&lt;/strong&gt;：保存於磚室墓中，有神仙思想的動物紋，也有程式化的木口紋。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;日本彌生時代&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
彌生時代：東京彌生町發現以農耕文化為代表的陶器，下限為公元三百年頃。是伴隨水稻生產的銅石並用的文化。&lt;strong&gt;銅鐸&lt;/strong&gt;成為該期受中國影響最有代表性的藝術文物。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;銅鐸&lt;/strong&gt;：出土於近畿和瀨戶內海沿線，可能是銅鐘和馬鐸的結合體。按大小分為大中小三種。&lt;br&gt;
銅鐸紋樣：橫帶紋、袈裟襷紋、流水紋、凸線帶紋。&lt;strong&gt;顯示了該時代金屬工藝的巔峰。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
銅鐸上的紋樣是該時代紋樣的集成，有的還是珍貴的繪畫。這些繪畫以鑄成的&lt;strong&gt;凸線構成&lt;/strong&gt;，通過&lt;strong&gt;線條&lt;/strong&gt;表現形象。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;日本古墳時代&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
古墳時代：公元3-6世紀，受漢墓影響出現封土高大的宏偉墳墓。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;銅鏡&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;br&gt;
古墳出土的銅鏡類型：“舶入鏡”；“仿制鏡”；獨創意匠的“日式鏡”。&lt;br&gt;
直弧紋鏡：直線和弧線的巧妙組合。&lt;br&gt;
房屋紋鏡：寫實表現當時的四種民居。&lt;br&gt;
狩獵紋鏡：描繪逐鹿獵手，構圖自由氣氛活躍。&lt;br&gt;
和歌山八幡神社畫像鏡：古紋後期作品，表明日本這此時已能全部理解中國鏡的形式。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“漢倭奴國王”金印&lt;/strong&gt;是已知首次傳播到日本的漢字。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;銘文大刀&lt;/strong&gt;：約438年，出土於熊本縣江田古墳。&lt;br&gt;
刀背上刻制銘文並用銀鑲嵌，被認為是日本現存最早的在日本書寫的文字。&lt;br&gt;
這種在金屬上銘刻的素樸文字，可以說是日本書法的萌芽。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/what-are-emotions-for/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the story that a parent rescued their daughter and perished, we can learn that self-sacrifice is an irrational urge from emotion. Our emotion is an extraordinary power that guides us to handle the challenges of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN PASSIONS OVERWHELM REASON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From the tragedy that happened in Crabtree, we can learn that passions always overwhelm ration time and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impulses to Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In our emotional repertoire, each plays a unique role.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;pre class=&#34;wp-block-preformatted&#34;&gt;作者认为柏拉图对艺术的看法不妥。但在柏拉图的观点中，可以说艺术和他要建立的真理与乌托邦是对立的，本身就是有局限性的。柏拉图认为艺术应被禁止再现罪恶性情、放荡、粗鲁，是否也可以说柏拉图在批判摹仿性艺术满足人低劣的那一部分？&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在古希腊中常有和欲望有关的故事，如对于古希腊神话中常有的身体幻化，我认为是很好的例子，如宙斯的幻化、阿波罗幻化成月桂树、牛头怪，人马兽也是其中之一，比如人马兽是国王伊克西翁被宙斯所塑造的涅斐勒所生，最终半人马被神所杀死。&lt;br&gt;
喀戎是一个例外具有良好的品格，被徒弟赫拉克勒斯在追杀半人马强盗时误伤，喀戎本是不死之身，但赫拉克勒斯的箭浸泡了九头蛇的血，喀戎感到疼痛最终放弃永生换取普罗米修斯的自由。&lt;br&gt;
半人马一般被当作野蛮，情欲，酗酒的代表，半人马被认为是酒神的追随者。人马可以表示着上半身、人的理性驾驭不了下半身的欲望？最终人马被神所杀死，喀戎也成为悲剧的代表，是否也意味着着这种野蛮、情欲的代名词，在古希腊中它最终要被神惩罚？半人马的故事对我们理解艺术尼采的酒神精神有什么启示？&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;柏拉图和亚历士多德艺术思想的比较：&lt;br&gt;
柏拉图认为，艺术只是完美、永恒的本原的一种有缺陷的再模仿，人们从这种虚假模仿中是得不到真理（美）的；亚历士多德则肯定艺术家创作过程本身的作用，同时通过艺术作品对自然的模仿，人们更能深刻理解对象的美。&lt;br&gt;
柏拉图认为，因为来自“灵感”、“礼物”，艺术是有力量的，同时也是危险的。为了保护理想的公民和理想的社会，艺术等级不高，必须严格控制；亚历士多德则认为艺术的模仿是一种教育和学习形式，是有价值的。&lt;br&gt;
柏拉图认为，艺术家的灵感来源于神性的启发而不是一种技能，因此艺术家相比医药、建筑、算术等需要技巧的一类人更低级；亚历士多德则更为乐观，认为这种创造艺术的能力隐含在“模仿”之中，同样需要大量的学习和练习。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The place of the earthquake is a test case of the one-child policy. So many parents lost their own child in the earthquake in 2008. After the quake, the Communist party recede the propaganda of the policy but banned the news about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This policy may be made China less productive, some people fired and lose their job because of this policy, it is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWO TYPES OF PROFESSIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are two types of professions, employee and taxi driver, though the first one has a high salary and stable, it’s fragile. This profession is in a system of artificial and human-made. But the second one is antifragile, same kind profession corporates artisan, prostitute, etc. Nature like small mistakes and variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenin in Zurich&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because Swiss have no government, it formed a bottom-up system that causes stability. There is no big idea that can generate in this country. It’s a magnet for ugly rich and tax refugees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Destroy the enemy’s plan is the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;攻城之法為不得已。修槽鎮輕、具器械、三月而後成&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
During the war, we need a full preparation to besiege a walled city. It will spend a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;將不勝其忿, 而儀附之&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The general may lose their patience before the engines of attacking prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;拔人之城而非攻也, 人之國而非久也。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, the skilled generals will overthrow their kingdom without any operations. They will not harm individuals but destroy the government. The typical instance is the Wu Wang, who put an end of the &lt;em&gt;Yin&lt;/em&gt; dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;focusing-on-starting-vs-finishing&#34;&gt;FOCUSING ON STARTING VS. FINISHING&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective managers always have the ability to communicate with their employees. Focusing on starting is much more effective for a perfectionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;getting-results-or-giving-criticism&#34;&gt;GETTING RESULTS OR GIVING CRITICISM&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to give praise instead of criticism for employees. Praise even needs to precede the recommendations for improvement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;State Your Priorities Clearly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t change your priority too often.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Be Decisive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You need to be decisive and don’t change the goal during the project. When you choose one, don’t change it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Be Fair and Frequent in Your Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Craving to be appreciated is a deep need in human nature.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;LIVING WITH A PROCRASTINATOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maybe you are living with a procrastinator, you didn’t need to put commands do them, just say I would instead of you should.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A LAST WORD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Go ahead! Don’t say I’ll try or it’s not working, just be open-minded and do it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLANNED SETBACKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can try to plan procrastination when you meet a big project, and record your self-statement, these statements may be your old pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;resilience-and-hardiness&#34;&gt;RESILIENCE AND HARDINESS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Resilience is very important when you fail, every time you fail you can bounce back from it and know your performance isn’t your self-worth, but your performance is connected to your perseverance. You don’t need to be responsible for what had happened to you, but you need to be responsible for how to tackle these problems. Sarah’s experience told us that you will meet some obstacles placed by others, but you don’t need to put these pressure on yourself, you just need to set a time for yourself and see how much you can finish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you exposed a war too long, even you are ingenious, you will make a mistake. leave a little to your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;力屈，財襌（殫），中原內需於家，百姓之費，十去其七&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Waging a war, you need to forage on your enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USING MORE OF YOUR BRAIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Using your left side of your brain is important, you need to shift into a state of flow. You need to stop your linear thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT’S ONLY YOUR FIRST DRAFT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Creativity is important, how to get into it? You need to suspend criticism and linear thought and get into the state of flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/curator-and-exhibition/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Curator 是一个专有名称，曾经被作为“博物馆馆长”之意。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;做一个策展人要具备资金筹措能力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;故宫的展览负责人以前是一个机构，以前很稳定。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从展览体制上日本的博物馆和西方没有区别，学艺员的背景是艺术史和博物馆学。 近20年当代形态的艺术开始进入博物馆。 以现当代艺术命名的博物馆开始出现。（美国惠特尼博物馆）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从策展人到独立策展人体现能力的提升可以把各种资源有效的进行组合。&lt;br&gt;
他不涉及到卖作品，画廊和策展人没关系。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果要想做一个和它相关的展览是不是具备可能性，很多当代艺术的展览模式可能就是需要展览空间。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他们能敏感的发现社会当中的一个动向。泽曼先生被当成最早的独立策展人。&lt;br&gt;
策展人在很大程度上是思维的先知者。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some parts on the inside of a system may be required to be fragile in order to make the system antifragile as a result.&lt;/em&gt; All restaurants are combating with each other in order to form the antifragility of the whole group. If a single restaurant is too robust when the crisis happens, all reasons are boil down to the fragile of this restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;evolution-and-unpredictability&#34;&gt;Evolution and Unpredictability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature (and nature-like systems) likes diversity between organisms rather than diversity within an immortal organism…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Evolutions benefits from the randomness but the unit died from the harms.&lt;br&gt;
So I need to build some new systems different than the habit system, such as an energy managing system or log system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, the author introduced the families of Mi-ran and Jun-sang, Mi-ran’s father is a warrior from South Korea and he was captive by North army, he was forced to be a miner in Chojin (that town in northeastern), but he never told this to his daughters and son, until this tainted blood effects their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jun-sang’s family is from Japan, they are wealthy as Japanese-Korean. when Korea divided, some Japanese-Korean thought the North government is better than South as a group battled with Japanese, so they went to North, but after the regime formed, they noticed everything changed, Kim Il-sung, never believe them, they were purged because God Kim didn’t allow them to be wealthier than common North Korea people and to connect their relatives in Japan. They couldn’t go back to Japan forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;蔡元培&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

转机：中国近代美术教育史上的一大转机，莫过于新美术教育的崛起。&lt;br&gt;
画馆画家：上海开埠后的土山湾画馆和官办美术机构还远远享受不了建立了中国近代美术教育摇篮的美誉。广东西洋画家群相比之下诞生了更多的画家。&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;公众态度公众责任如何建立？&lt;br&gt;
很多民间的组织开始带领公众参观博物馆。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们可以从社会端参与到其中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一、当代社会语境下的博物馆下的博物与公众&lt;br&gt;
博物馆与公众关系紧密与否，关系到博物馆的成熟度。&lt;br&gt;
近20年来，多数博物馆开始制订积极的&lt;strong&gt;公众战略&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;br&gt;
如果纳稅人的钱并未投入到想要的地方。&lt;br&gt;
理想的地方是纳稅人的钱可以投入到他理想的地方。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在政府财政危机的时候博物馆应该规避风险。&lt;br&gt;
“博物馆独立运动”&lt;br&gt;
博物馆的服务方面打开后就开始市场化运动。&lt;br&gt;
如何让它们之间的关系健康化。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二、博物馆与公众关系的良性循环&lt;br&gt;
关于“内向型”和“外向型”的博物馆的态度：&lt;br&gt;
我们不要批判旧博物馆学，而是要让旧博物馆学变成新博物馆学。&lt;br&gt;
组碍：公众与博物馆文化上的格阂。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;引发的问题的思考：&lt;br&gt;
1、应当由谁来决定博物馆展出什么？（专业/非）&lt;br&gt;
公众往往会有非专业的需求。&lt;br&gt;
2、社会大众的兴趣和需求是怎样确定的，博物馆应如何对比作出反应？&lt;br&gt;
很多的当代的艺术展是小朋友喜欢的&lt;br&gt;
3、在满足大众需求中如何看待日益增长的多民族和多元文化问题。&lt;br&gt;
这是任何一个博物馆应该关注的问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;798出现的多元文化的画廊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;诠释的视野&lt;br&gt;
它让人感受到是必要的&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a love story between two teenagers, Mi-ran and Jun-Sang, although it happened in the most totalitarian country in the world–North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mi-ran is a girl, her father is a miner, Jun-Sang is a student belongs to a family at a high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, the country’s economy broke down, and there is not enough electric power to keep the night be lighten, but the night in North Korea, it’s more natural and beautiful than other countries, no noises, no neons. What’s more, no one can spy the two teenagers, holding hands in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We seem like we don’t work for a living but work for dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to think about how to see our jobs, in this world, we have a caste system of job, we divide them from their salaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In America, though most people make 6,000$ a month still not happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like we have no choice and just be in the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Limits to Growth:&lt;/strong&gt; We are in the corner of growth, we think growth is the truth, we think more is better, but nature is finite, though technology will help us, the government will help us, but we don’t think about the problems of ourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;The Master said to Yan Yuan, “If I’m employed, I’ll show my talent; If not, I’ll hide my light under a bushel, only you and I have the ability to do it!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zi Lu said, “If you lead troops, whom do you want to work with you?” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Master Said, “If someone attacks a tiger unarmed or crosses a river without a boat, and he died without any regret, I would not work with him. What I need definitely is someone who is careful and fond of making plans for success.”&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;organic and mechanical are different, organisms are antifragile, also for human-beings. But in modern society, humans all live longer but weak, because the environment is so fragile. Unlike natural environment, their working environment, medicine and living quarters all making them weaker and weaker. Unlike mechanicals, organisms will become stronger because of self-repair in some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man-made mechanicals are complicated but not complex, If you break them down, they don’t cause a ripple effect. But human society or ecology is complex, if you exterminate a specific animal, you will disrupt a food chain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If you restrict your time of the study, you may have an aversion about it, you want to break the authority for yourself, and you will find you will increase your time of the study. So, set a rule of your working time, like “don’t work more than four hours a day”, you’ll find you want to work more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;蔡元培与美术教育&#34;&gt;蔡元培与美术教育&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;蔡元培在留学期间，康德“美的超越性与普遍性”的理念对他产生了深远影响。&lt;br&gt;
1916年辞去教育总长职务&lt;br&gt;
1917年：做“美育代宗教说”演讲&lt;br&gt;
他认为美术在变革社会中具有重要的作用。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;向北洋政府建议开办美术学校&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
担任北大校长期间发起成立北大画法研究会&lt;br&gt;
蔡元培极力支持林凤眠执掌国立北京艺术学校&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;从北京美术学校到国立北平艺术专科学校&#34;&gt;从北京美术学校到国立北平艺术专科学校&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;五四新文化运动的“美育”思潮推动了美术教育的发展，使得美术教育脱离了实业教育的阶段。&lt;br&gt;
1918年：国立北京美术学校成立，郑锦任校长&lt;br&gt;
1921年：改称北京美术专门学校&lt;br&gt;
1925年：增设音乐、戏剧二系，改称北京艺术专门学校&lt;br&gt;
1927年：奉系时期改称为京师大学美术专门部&lt;br&gt;
林凤眠聘请齐白石任教&lt;br&gt;
1934年：教育部令恢复国立北平艺术专科学校&lt;br&gt;
1937年：全面抗战爆发，学校南迁&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;../uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_20191028_204634.png&#34;&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在林风眠的组织下，1927年5月1日，北京艺专师生联合社会的进步艺术社团组织了艺术大会，美术系举办美术展览，共展览了2000余幅作品，这些作品多抨击社会、讽刺现实。&lt;br&gt;
事后，林风眠发表《致全国艺术界书》，指出没有国内真正创造的艺术品（模特儿事件），后林风眠被迫辞职。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;国立杭州艺术专科学校-与林风眠的美术教育活动&#34;&gt;国立杭州艺术专科学校 与林风眠的美术教育活动&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1927年，国民政府定都南京，为改变当时国内艺术教育萎靡不振的情况下，蔡元培倡议设立国民艺术教育委员会，同年，在委员会议上通过“筹建国立艺术大学”提案。由林风眠、林文铮、王代之负责建校。&lt;br&gt;
1929年：国立艺术院举行开学典礼。&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;../uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_20191029_210304.png&#34;&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1929年秋，学校改名为国立杭州艺术专科学校&lt;/p&gt;</description>

1925年：江苏省教育会通过禁止模特的提案。刘海粟发信置辩，数天后江苏省教育会回信澄清所禁模特为市场托名的裸体画。此事件引起极大反响。&lt;br&gt;
保守势力开始大张挞伐，上海市议员姜怀素在《申报》发文，严禁模特，严惩刘海粟，刘海粟发文驳斥；上海总商会会长、实业家朱葆三致信刘海粟，认为刘海粟蛊惑青年男女。&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;灶：Legge: furnance; Eno: the kitchen god; Lau: the kitchen stove&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;奥： Legge: the south-west corner; Eno: the god of the dark corner; Lau: the south-west corner of the house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legge translated “问曰”into “asked, saying” . Comparing to “asked” (Eno’s translation) and “said” (Lau’s translation) , Legge translated both words. Wangsun Jia asked a question after “问曰”in this chapter, so it is also understandable if only translate “问曰”into “asked” or “said”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;【十三章】【一節】王孫賈問曰、與其媚於奧、寧媚於竈、何謂也。【二節】子曰、不然、獲罪於天、無所禱也。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legge’s translation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter XIII. 1. Wang-sun Chia asked, saying, “What is the meaning of the saying, ‘It is better to pay court to the furnace than to the south-west corner?&amp;rsquo;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Master said, “Not so. He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentary: THAT THERE IS NO RESOURCE AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF VILATING THE RIGHT. Kea is the great officer of Wei, and having the power of the state in his hands, insinuated Confucius that it would be for his advantage to pay court to him. The southwest corner was from the structure of ancient houses the cosiest nook, and the place of honour.&lt;br&gt;
Choo He explains the proverb by reference to the customs of sacrifice.&lt;br&gt;
The furnace was comparatively a mean place, but when the spirit of the furnace was sacrificed to, then the rank of the two places was changed for the time, and the proverb quoted was in vogue. But there does not seem much force in this explanation. The &lt;em&gt;door&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;, or any other of the five things in the regular sacrifices, might take the place of the furnace.&lt;br&gt;
2 Confucius’ reply was in a high tone. Choo He says, “Heaven means principle” But why should Heaven mean principle, if there were not in such a use of the term an instinctive recognition of a supreme government of intelligence and righteousness We find the term explained by “The lofty one who is on high”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The author thinks we cannot just live alone, we need to have a belonging, but maybe love other people is hurt other people’s freedom. What’s more, we think we are in a group or a community, we can feel we are superior than others. we all need help, but sometimes we always hide this and think we are better than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to think we are superior to others, we build walls, make our group against other groups, prejudice cultivates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE IMPORTANCE OF PLAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play can make us more effective, more creative, producers have more time to play than procrastinators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to know that play is important, through recreation and playing we get creativity. So in order to improve efficiency we need to spend time to play. We need plan for some time to play, producers always living without stressing about don’t finish the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;新博物馆学视野下博物馆认知&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;《当卢浮宫遇见紫禁城》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;博物馆学的三次研究高潮发生于30、50、80年代&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30:世界范围内第一次研究高潮&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50:世界博物馆学研究出现第二次高潮，开始成为世界性的事业&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20世纪60年代初期，博物馆学的活动逐渐独立并且清晰起来，博物馆组织的分类开始基于功能加以区分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;80年代中期，“新博物馆学”运动&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;广阔的社会背景：20世纪70年代随着全球性的生态危机和社区主义的发展，人们开始思考，博物馆和社会到底是一个什么样的关系？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;新博物馆学 理论基础：除方法与技术外，还要懂政治学、社会学等多学科&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;发展策略：观众需要为主，大众主义，专家参与&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;展示手法：动态的，采用主题单元展示，内容侧重内在与未来，尽量让观众参与，注意娱乐与休闲，多种传播方式。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人如果只是私密化存在的话，社会是难以进步的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;新博物馆学对博物馆的多重认识：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;博物馆可以是不同形式的空间：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“飞地” 人类可以通过这块飞地领略人类文化遗产。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“圣地” 它有广阔的历史时刻的特征，与宗教有关联，我们赋予了它极其崇高的地位。“偶像意象”、“治疗的潜能”、“仪式化之所”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“市场主导产业”&lt;/strong&gt; 文化场所应该成为市场主导的形态。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“殖民化空间”&lt;/strong&gt; “展览是有特权的舞台，展示着自我与‘他者’的意象。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;艺术博物馆：文化表征的特征空间&lt;/strong&gt; 无论是避难所、诊所还是监狱等，均是权力和知识关系的体制化的表现。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;艺术博物馆并非艺术经典的简单承载体。每一种展品的定夺无不是建立在人的文化认知与判断之上的。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I also feel lonely last week, but I walked out recently.&lt;br&gt;
I’m sorry to hear that you didn’t live with your parents 🙁&lt;br&gt;
I think maybe it’s the reason you still struggling against loneliness.&lt;br&gt;
In the book ‘Becoming human’, belonging is very important, we need belongings.&lt;br&gt;
I’m so sorry my language is not very well? but I’m willing to hear your stories, through words, I hope we can build a good friendship ?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;如何达到自己的目标？有时候并不是我们没有能力达到，而是我们总是在中途放弃了。我们在跌倒的时候不断的质疑自己，如果我们爬起了，再次起来，我们总有可能到达最终的目的地，而当我们放弃了，我们就真的会认为：我们没有能力去做了。我们不断编织这样的谎言去否定自己，最终我们将自己囚禁在谎言的牢笼中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;子曰、不有祝鮀之佞、而有宋朝之美、難乎免於今之世矣。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;留学日本的中国学生与美术教育&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;西方文化进入近代中国后，也冲击着传统的教育制度，洋务运动时期清政府即派学生赴美留学。1905年，清政府废弃科举制度，延续千年的文人传统升迁之途就此废弃，留学海外、学习西方文化与知识便成为读书人新的目标。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;日本是学习西方成功的代表，文化语言生活习惯与中国相似，同时日本政府为学生提供种种便利，因此日本成为当时留学生首选的目的地之一。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1906年左右的10年间，赴日留学生达2万余人，许多人学成归国后推动了各地的美术教育，如早期的曾延年、李叔同，曾延年学成回到家乡四川，担任成都高等示范学校艺术教职。北京、江苏、四川为赴日留学大省，这些地区的新式教育发展得更加完备，同时很多学校直接仿照日本教学模式办学，开设西洋画科，也聘请日本教员任教习。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;留学日本的画家有，陈师曾、何香凝、高剑父、周湘、陈树人、陈抱一、张善噂、张大千、丰子恺、刘海粟等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;留学欧美的中国学生与美术教育&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关作霖为代表的外销画家是最早留学欧洲的画家，之后留学欧洲的还有李铁夫、周湘、李毅士等。随着新文化运动的兴起，在“民主”、“科学”思潮洗礼下，留学法欧成为风气，不少人半工半读，这一时期的代表有林凤眠、徐悲鸿等。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’m not an extreme person in any topic, I need to have my life and my own goal, but because of my personality, I stick to some thinking that makes me different from others, in the end, it doesn’t make me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dreams(like become a native speaker or improve my skill and knowledge reserve very fast) are building in the air, not in the reality, why I cannot enjoy the road?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;High levels are abstract. People alway want to go higher level thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting to low levels has two benefits, the first is people can avoid the control of high levels, the second is, people escape from strong emotions like anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People usually change between high levels and low levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness can occurs at different levels, at low levels, like pain and movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-worth is very important if they cannot justify their actions and feel progress for their goals, self-worth will be very low.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Imaging that we always transform the task to a board before ourself, we can perform well if this board is on the land, but if the board is suspended between two buildings 100 feet above the pavement, then we are fearful to pass it.What’s more, we always feel a fire behind ourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always fell in self-criticism so we use procrastinate to put off tasks until the deadline. It’s a victim mentality that we think we have to, no we will.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The author got some experiences which saw so many disabilities, they full of loneliness, painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A human being needs a companion, and we need truths and make our worlds or communities better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;community-and-rigid-order&#34;&gt;Community and Rigid Order&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paradox between the desire to belong, to fit in a community and to serve the deepest mind for oneself, close to God and be freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;the-weakness-of-a-child&#34;&gt;The Weakness of a Child&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all born with weakness, we need love from parents as we cannot survive without others help. So if we don’t get love from the outside world, we will feel lonely. A lonely child will construct protection to survive and close his heart, but a child who gets love will more open to the world. we all have a lonely child in our heart, a lonely child can make us survive but also can destruct us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The agriculture developed, many towns developed, so the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 7000 BCE, they developed stone buildings to defend nomad, it’s a great achievement, and they used the skulls for rituals, also using plaster to restore the skull, and inlaid seashells as eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;ain-ghazal&#34;&gt;Ain Ghazal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They remarked the beginning of monumental sculptures in Mesopotamia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It developed the depiction of the human body, the shape of the torso, not only the profile. It also has the first depiction of a setting devoid of both humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the reason I always want to text with others is that maybe I want a connection with others to replace my relatives, but I should fish or cut the bait between the connection with others (the emotion relationship build by my parents) or my self-development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Dorothy shows that procrastination is the choice between the self-improvement and others jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to unlearn the pattern that my tasks are associated with the mind that I am lazy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What shall be my subject? -animals, but men are rare. They’re almost profiled because the only profile can show the essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;western-europe&#34;&gt;Western Europe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleolithic human-headed shows that the ivory figure is very important for the artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nude woman shows fertility images. The intents of makers maybe the female form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient artists always painted statuette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sculptors usually change the subject to keep the profile view and details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is why painters want to paint in these cavern, some people believe that these bison can provide food for them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Different types of creatures cannot understand each other. It’s because there are different factors affecting, such as longevity and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu You’s saying means name is the only guest of reality. We should think about whether we can fit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is useless in one place can be very useful in other places, like the cream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who made it? From the personal style, art historian can attribute who made these art works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who paid for it? Patrons always have a big influence when artists are commissioned. They can change subjects and style in an artwork, under these circumstances, personal style is not important. So it is necessary to know who paid for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic words for art historian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form and composition (not only two dimensions but also 3D)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;sovereign should have moral law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the war, you should think about whether moral law is sit on your side, if not, you lose Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the war, you should create the situation for success, and make the plan for better circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All warfare is based on deception, so we should deceive both of our friends and enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your opponent is bad temper, irritate him. Observe your enemy, if they are in ease, make him not rest, if they are united, separate him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Masochism and sadism</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/masochism-and-sadism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Freud’s theory, masochism is from sadism, another theory said that sadism and masochism are two faces of one coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the recent study shows that maybe masochism is more fundamental. The number of Masochists are much more than sadists’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submissive partners are really in control during SM, because it is the submissive’s desire shapes the sex play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masochistic desires are much stronger than sadistic. But many submissive people cannot find a partner to dominate them because of the shortage. So What happens often is two masochists meet each other, one of them should take turns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is art history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art history aims to learn and find the history and development of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions art historians should ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How old is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it’s style?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  梦饮酒者，旦而哭泣；梦哭泣者，旦而田猎。方其梦也，不知其梦也。梦之中又占其梦焉，觉而后知其梦也。且有大觉而后知此其大梦也，而愚者自以为觉，窃窃然知之。君乎，牧乎，固哉！丘也与女，皆梦也；予谓女梦，亦梦也。是其言也，其名为吊诡。万世之后而一遇大圣，知其解者，是旦暮遇之也。
&lt;/p&gt;

  不能直接看成美学和艺术理论：动物也许会死，重要的是我们会死但我们没有意识到会死。如果我们按照以前的方式，去超越现象追求本能打手电筒，做不到的时候我们还作为本体在世界存在，把现象只看成现象，不再痛苦，（丢了现象，不是本质的东西）如果我们把喜怒哀乐看成现象，就不会完全束缚在一个固定的地方，我们不应该被它所欺骗，我们在一个日常的梦中，把梦当梦时会更真实一点。这里就出现了一种艺术形式，当我们有一天看见一个东西，假象会教育我们，我们的现象不是真的。因此，恰恰相反，我们尝试画是假的，生活是真的，但画教育我们更真实的东西。这不是虚幻的欢乐，用一种方式。告诉我们我们在生活里面扮演戏剧。戏剧家告诉你们你在日常生活中也是一个存在的方式。艺术不是人类的消遣：它是让我们反过来让我们更真实的东西。如果我们只是意识到现象是现象，保持距离，会感觉虚幻和绝望。&lt;br /&gt; 我们必须在现象世界中入手 意识到自己是本体，作为本体，你和现象世界中本来就没有距离 。现象就是本体上开出的一朵花。我们意识到自己是本体，但要投身于现象的世界中。（美学笔记）
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因此，“庄周梦蝶”、“人生如戏”可以用尼采的反理性主义与美学解释：我们做梦经常意识不到自己会做梦，有时会意识到，但我们最终是会醒的。会醒的梦和人生这个不会醒的梦哪个更高级？人生的梦更低级，这个梦的现象太真实我们做得太投入了，以至于我们意识不到这是场梦。 理性最终能认识的、关心的只是现象世界。用再精密的仪器不停的拆分现象，在现象中打转，用手电筒照亮用眼睛看都已经是观察现象，用苏格拉底的“理性”是不可能达到本体世界的，如果只是相信知识和理性，我们就离本体越来越远。 尼采认为戏剧中的悲剧是肯定人生的最高艺术，我们不能消极、放弃“现象”，去“苦修”。因为本体永远不能脱离现象而存在，我们无法认识到本体的我，但现象就是“本体上开出的一朵花”，我们可以“作为”本体而存在，去做这一场梦。就算人生是一场杯具，我们不仅作为观众来看戏，还要作为演员入戏。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I can read and found my writing through multi-level categories, classify them and reflect efficiently. I also can discover everything I wrote before through categories, like time traveling, know myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;意识形态批评&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;意识形态不是强加在我们上面的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;走出意识形态是痛苦的，意识形态会使你看到真相。自由是痛苦的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;幻想正是组成意识形态的重要材料。幻想提供了简单的解答。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;过去的纯粹的消费主义，现在变得非常狡猾。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;颠覆斯大林主义的独裁不仅仅在于嘲笑领袖，还要破坏得以存在的依据——“人民”。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I remember the ocean, Memories die out so hard. We were traveling the mountains, just to find the loudest seas. We settled down by the fire, knowing we could aim higher, but we didn’t know that yet. So if you want something to hold on to, gotta find it first. But here I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Cause I’ve been laying under palm trees, waiting for the summer, knowing there’s nowhere to do. ‘Cause I am happy on this island, Wanna be my funland? I don’t ever want to leave, I’m in a tropic love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;吴门画派的文人画家都有着和文征明一样早年仕儒、晚年隐居不仕的经历，陆治也不例外。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;陆治与文征明的交往大约于嘉靖二年（1523年）开始，他同文征明一同交游，并创作了大量的游记作品，并学习文氏画风陆治还与陈淳、王毂祥等同门关系甚好。文征明和陆治虽然没有明确的师生关系，但是陆治的早期风格受到文的影响。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;陆治的《雪窗易见图》与文征明的《溪山深雪图》用笔节奏、留白十分相似。这种构图与笔法在王蒙的《具区林屋图》中也可以找到。可以推测出陆治从文征明的绘画风格探索到了王蒙的笔意。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;清钱杜《松壶画忆》中提到在文众多弟子中，“陆叔平得其奇峭”。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;文征明追求的已经不是宋人的工细，而是上求于顾恺之那样的“纤妙之迹”了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文征明的因为工于人物，所以他点景人物画的点景人物十分成功。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  The most important decision you&amp;#8217;ll ever make: Change your categories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of willingness to change your categories is dogmatic, and your categories become chains that restrict your growth. On the other hand, your categories may change so wildly that they become meaningless and without something to anchor you, you fall into an endless abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;
  Perhaps, the most important category you&amp;#8217;ll construct is one of yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every category you impose one the world is one that you also impose on yourself and you decide if you do or don’t fit into that category.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  Goal: supportive of yourself
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions about yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time (vague terms such as “sometime next week” )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals and value. (distracted by another plan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mood, fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our real distress comes from constant anxiety of delaying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to notice the healing system. But Why we procrastinate? Because we fear a threat to our independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fear of judgment is the key fear that stems from over-identifying who you are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have been using Anki for two years.&lt;br&gt;
It is one of the best learning and memorizing software I have ever met. It is open-source, freedom and personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-image&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have added 18,000 cards in the English desk, making my English from slag to intermediate level where I can read English articles.&lt;br&gt;
I also created other types of desks, related to my major and my interests.&lt;br&gt;
The next steps are to improve my knowledge base of my major: create cards I should memorize, check my cards’ grammar and add some necessary pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is supposed to be an essential part of life. Organizing one’s words and works in the form of a blog is less fickle than social media-style sharing, and there are no more meaningless likes and comments; compared to keeping it private for oneself, and sharing it with those who need it. I created this blog to record myself and share my thoughts, articles and works. ：)&lt;/p&gt;
