AI is a very useful tool now, and it would be highly beneficial if we can learn to use it effectively.\nIn terms of learning English, I have found a lot of useful tools that are built upon artificial intelligence. One of these tools is DeepL, which I noticed several years ago. The quality of its translation is far better than Google Translate. I can smoothly translate an article into another language without worrying about its readability. Moreover, I can easily find a suitable word on DeepL if I forget its expression in another language.\nIn addition to this, I have also found some AI-powered tools for web designing.

As a result, I am willing to post my articles written in English online.
