Several days ago I searched some pieces of music on Youtube and listening. when I‚Äôm listening to this music and saw the comments below. I‚Äôm very touched and weeping.
I haven‚Äôt weeped for a long time, remember that the last weep was two years ago.

I just wanted to let you know how important is for me to read all your beautiful comments. To read that someone can feel more relax or empowered and even that this music can help you a little bit to endure your struggle with depression, is something that‚Äôs beyond what a composer could ask for and makes me feel a sense of purpose and a strength to move on with my life too. Sadly, sometimes we (myself) are knock out by many cirumcustancies‚Ä¶, and although we all know that eventually things will pass, it‚Äôs really hard to move on. At such dark times it is good to cling to what life gives to us‚Ä¶, it may be an idea, a dream, a song‚Ä¶, or even a series of warm comments in a video on you tube (that‚Äôs the case). Anything goes to keep going on, to return back to our light.\nI just wanted to show you my gratitude and also encourage you all. Feel free to listen to my track Suns and Stars (Really Slow Motion). It‚Äôs there on you tube. Not propaganda. I think that track really can help you also to feel empowered, uplifted and happy‚Ä¶, even if just makes you smile or dream for a second, it will be worthwhile üôÇ\nThanks also to HDSounDI for sharing my work. See you soon ^_^ Nobody\n3 months ago (edited)\nLittle kid : why does great people die ? Father : imagine you at the garden full of flowers, which one do you pick ?\nLittle kid : the most beautiful one\nFather : (look at the skies) exactly. to everyone whom is listening and feeling alone‚Ä¶ you are in my prayers.\nnever give up. life is precious. sending a ray of sunlight to everyone who needs it. I‚Äôll be your friend, doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, who old o young you are, doesn‚Äôt matter what you look like or what religion or nationality you have. listen to the soft music: unable to perceive the shape of music, you find it all around you. it‚Äôs presence fills your eyes with love. it humbles your heart, for it‚Äôs everywhere xoxo Marit ","wordCount":"462","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2019-09-18T04:36:10Z","dateModified":"2019-09-18T04:36:10Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Qiran"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/touched/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li><li><a href=/zh/ title=‰∏≠ aria-label=‰∏≠>Zh</a></li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=en/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=en/about-me-2/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=en/reading-list/ title="Reading list"><span>Reading list</span></a></li><li><a href=en/my-friends/ title=Friends><span>Friends</span></a></li><li><a href=en/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=en/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=/en/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Touched</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2019-09-18 04:36:10 +0000 +0000'>September 18, 2019</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Qiran</div></header><div class=post-content><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class=wp-block-embed__wrapper></div></figure><p>Several days ago I searched some pieces of music on Youtube and listening. when I‚Äôm listening to this music and saw the comments below.
